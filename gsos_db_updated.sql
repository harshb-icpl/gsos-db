The flaw was addressed with improved state management.\r\nCVE-2021-30762 - A use-after-free issue that could be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution when processing maliciously crafted web content. The flaw was resolved with improved memory management.\r\nBoth CVE-2021-30761 and CVE-2021-30762 were reported to Apple anonymously, with the Cupertino-based company stating in its advisory that it\'s aware of reports that the vulnerabilities \"may have been actively exploited.\" As is usually the case, Apple didn\'t share any specifics on the nature of the attacks, the victims that may have been targeted, or the threat actors that may be abusing them.\r\n\r\nOne thing evident, however, is that the active exploitation attempts were directed against owners of older devices such as iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPod touch (6th generation). The move mirrors a similar fix that Apple rolled out on May 3 to remediate a buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2021-30666) in WebKit targeting the same set of devices.\r\n\r\nPrevent Data Breaches\r\nAlong with the two aforementioned flaws, Apple has patched a total of 12 zero-days affecting iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS since the start of the year â€”\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1782 (Kernel) - A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges\r\nCVE-2021-1870 (WebKit) - A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution\r\nCVE-2021-1871 (WebKit) - A remote attacker may be able to cause arbitrary code execution\r\nCVE-2021-1879 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to universal cross-site scripting\r\nCVE-2021-30657 (System Preferences) - A malicious application may bypass Gatekeeper checks\r\nCVE-2021-30661 (WebKit Storage) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution\r\nCVE-2021-30663 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution\r\nCVE-2021-30665 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution\r\nCVE-2021-30666 (WebKit) - Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution\r\nCVE-2021-30713 (TCC framework) - A malicious application may be able to bypass Privacy preferences\r\n,Image=news/images/Apple issues patches for 2 Zero Days.png', 'news/images/1.png', '', 'Users of Apple devices are recommended to update to the latest versions to mitigate the risk associated with the vulnerabilities.\r\n'),

(4, 'Data Breached of Volkswagen, Audi', '2021-06-21', 'ThreatPost', '\"(1)One of Volkswagen\'s vendors left one of its systems open for more than two years, exposing the personal information of 3.3 million customersâ€”nearly all of them were Audi owners or prospective Au', 'One of Volkswagenâ€™s vendors left one of its systems open for nearly two years, exposing the personal data of 3.3 million customers â€“ nearly all of them owners or wannabe owners of the automakerâ€™s luxury brand of Audis â€“ Volkswagen America said last week.\r\n\r\nThe breach took place between August 2019 and May 2021, Volkswagen said in a letter to the Maine Attorney General that was first spotted by TechCrunch reporter Zack Whittaker.\r\n\r\nThe car maker said that the data, mostly collected for sales and marketing, was exposed by a vendor used by Volkswagen, its Audi subsidiary and authorized dealers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor upwards of 97 percent of the affected customers, the third party got access to personal information about customers and prospective buyers, including names, postal and email addresses, and phone numbers.\r\n\r\nOther buyers or prospective buyers got hit harder, since they had more sensitive data â€“ including Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driverâ€™s license numbers â€“ stored on the vendorâ€™s leaky server, as Volkswagen explained in its letter:\r\n\r\nFor over 97% of the individuals, the exposed information consists solely of contact and vehicle information relating to Audi customers and interested buyers, including some or all of the following contact information: first and last name, personal or business mailing address, email address, or phone number. In some instances, the data also includes information about a vehicle purchased, leased, or inquired about, such as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), make, model, year, color, and trim packages.\r\n\r\nFor approximately 90,000 Audi customers or interested buyers, the data also includes more sensitive information relating to eligibility for a purchase, loan, or lease. Nearly all of the more sensitive data (over 95%) consists of driverâ€™s license numbers. A very small number of records include data such as dates of birth, Social Security or social insurance numbers, account or loan numbers, and tax identification numbers.\r\n\r\nWhy Did It Take Two Months to Secure that Server?\r\nVolkswagen said that it first heard about the breach on March 10. The company didnâ€™t explain why the leak continued up until last month as the unnamed vendor took two months to secure its server. Itâ€™s also unknown whether the data was downloaded by unauthorized third parties during the nearly two years it was left flapping open online. Threatpost has contacted Volkswagen for comment.\r\n\r\nAny of Volkswagenâ€™s customers or potential customers are at danger of fraud due to the breach. But customers who drive Audis are also susceptible to having their pricey rides ripped off: The 2021 Audi A4, for example, sets you back anywhere from $39,100 on up to $51,900.\r\n\r\nLuxury cars are protected by deluxe anti-theft technology, but that technology can be foiled. This video shows thieves breaking into an Audi RS4 in just 90 seconds, by breaking the window and plugging a device â€” assumed to be a piece of equipment available online thatâ€™s used to silence alarms and program blank key fobs â€” into the dashboard.\r\n\r\nBut cybercrooks donâ€™t have to resort to fancy gadgets to milk profits from car drivers. Instead, they can opt for less complex and sophisticated attacks, such as phishing or ransomware. Theyâ€™ve learned that the data that automotive companies have to offer â€“ from customer and employee personal identifiable information (PII) to financial data â€“ is invaluable.\r\n\r\nOne example was when an attacker installed a keystroke logger on the workstation of a car dealershipâ€™s finance specialist, to obtain their credentials and access customer credit reports. Another launched a ransomware attack on Toyota Australia, leading to delays in servicing and disruption in the supply of parts.\r\n\r\nUndeserved Trust Put in Unsecured Vendors\r\nJupiterOne CISO Sounil Yu noted that the breach points to a problem with supply chains: Namely, â€œWe put too much trust in them,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nYu pointed to President Bidenâ€™s recent Executive Order, pointing out that itâ€™s heavy on the push to Zero Trust architecture, but that itâ€™s â€œapplied primarily to things, such as networks and endpoints.â€\r\n\r\nHe suggested in an email to Threatpost on Monday that a Zero Trust approach be applied to suppliers as well, as opposed to the current practice of â€œsending vendors long questionnairesâ€ and only occasionally asking for proof about their answers.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe trust that those answers are correct and that the vendor is actually performing the security activities that they attested to,â€ he noted.\r\n\r\nDirk Schrader, global vice president at New Net Technologies, agreed: In an email to Threatpost on Monday, he called this breach â€œanother cyber gaffe in the third-party supply chain.â€\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while specialization is one of the main reasons for outsourcing to third parties, that specialization doesnâ€™t necessarily include cybersecurity, he observed. â€œWhether this is due to lack of resources, of knowledge, financial incentive or because Volkswagen â€“ being the reporting entity here â€“ didnâ€™t require certain standards and levels of protection in place is hard to say.â€\r\n\r\nMost likely itâ€™s â€œa toxic mixture of everything,â€ Schrader said. â€œFor the 3rd party, one lesson learned is an old one, â€˜youâ€™re never too benign, too small, too unknownâ€™, attackers will find you,â€ he emphasized.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it took the vendor and Volkswagen such a long time to detect the breach is â€œtellingâ€ when it comes to lack of capabilities,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nFor what itâ€™s worth, Schrader offered this interesting side note: â€œVolkswagen, being a German company, is also a member of the VDA (the German Association of the Automotive Industry). VDA has cyber security requirements in place for 3rd parties in this sector, addressing capabilities required.â€\r\n,Image=news/images/Data Breached of Volkswagen, Audi.png', 'news/images/4.png', '', '\r\n'),

Only four minutes were necessary for the company to determine that the account had infringed MEGA\'s terms of service (paragraph 15) by storing and sharing stolen files.\r\n\r\n\"MEGA has zero tolerance for any infringing or illegal material, and acts swiftly and effectively on accounts that violate our terms and conditions,\" - MEGA spokesperson\r\n\r\nThe representative added that the company \"cooperates fully with authorities\" in investigations and takes action to prevent illegal activity.\r\n\r\nThe ransomware attack on ADATA happened on May 23rd, 2021, forcing them to take systems offline, the company told BleepingComputer. As the Ragnar Locker leak clearly shows, ADATA did not pay the ransom and restored the affected systems on its own.\r\n\r\nThe ransomware actor claims stealing 1.5TB of sensitive files before deploying the encryption routine, saying that they took their time in the process because of the poor network defenses.\r\n\r\nâ€œSo then, as usual, we did offer to cooperate to fix the vulnerabilities and to restore their system and of course, avoid any publication regarding this issue, however, they didn\'t value much their own private information, as well as partners/clients/employees/customers informationâ€ - Ragnar Locker\r\n\r\nThe recently leaked batch of archives is the second one that Ragnar Locker ransomware publishes for ADATA. The previous one was posted earlier this month and includes four small 7-zip archives (less than 250MB together) that can still be downloaded.\r\n', 'news/images/16.png', '', '\r\n'),

The networking giant this week informed customers about the availability of patches for these flaws.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities were discovered by security researcher Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse, and they impact switches that run firmware versions earlier than 1.2.0.6 and have the web-based management interface enabled â€” the interface is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nIn an advisory released this week, Cisco said Lievisse Adriaanse found four types of security holes in the small business switches.\r\n\r\nOne of them, tracked as CVE-2021-1542 and rated high severity, can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to hijack a userâ€™s session and gain access to the switchâ€™s web interface. Depending on the privileges of the targeted user, the attacker could gain admin-level access to the management interface.\r\n\r\nAnother high-severity issue is CVE-2021-1541, which allows a remote attacker with admin permissions on the device to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nLievisse Adriaanse told SecurityWeek that while he hasnâ€™t tested this, it may be possible for an attacker to chain these two vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe other two flaws found by the researcher, both classified as medium severity by Cisco, could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to launch XSS attacks (CVE-2021-1543) or HTML injection attacks (CVE-2021-1571).\r\n\r\nâ€œ[In the case of the] XSS flaw, the vector which I tested and verified was by exploiting a vulnerability in how certain packets which are only valid on the same L2 domain are parsed,â€ Lievisse Adriaanse explained.\r\n\r\nHe added, â€œIt should be possible, if youâ€™re on the same L2 domain, to perform the XSS attack through CVE-2021-1543, obtain the CSRF token and perform arbitrary actions as the logged in user. As I donâ€™t write a lot of Javascript I didnâ€™t attempt to write a payload to subsequently exploit CVE-2021-1541. Note however that due to lacking Content-Security-Policy headers you can use CVE-2021-1543 to include remote Javascript code. So youâ€™re not limited by the packet size of the abused L2 protocol. I guess with enough experience and determination one could concoct a payload to do anything in the UI.â€\r\n\r\nAsked about a worst case theoretical attack scenario involving these vulnerabilities, the researcher said, â€œTheoretically speaking, the worst case scenario is someone on the same L2 domain performs the XSS attack and obtains administrative privileges (or pull off the authentication bypass) and while at it they could gain root on the underlying OS. I guess you could set up a span port and MiTM all traffic going through the switch, or perhaps find a way to gain persistence. With administrative access to the web interface and root on the underlying minimal Linux system the options are abundant.â€\r\n\r\nThe researcher said that while he hasnâ€™t checked, the impacted switches should not be directly exposed to the internet.\r\n\r\nCisco this week also announced patches for high-severity flaws affecting AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows (DLL hijacking by authenticated attacker), DNA Center (unauthenticated attacker can view and alter sensitive information), and Email Security and Web Security appliances (unauthenticated attacker can intercept traffic).\r\n', 'news/images/20.png', '', '\r\n'),

Recently, a new campaign has been observed leveraging a combination of several tricks to bypass the Secure Email Gateways (SEG) protection.\r\n\r\nWhat has been discovered?\r\nAccording to a report from Cofense, the phishing campaign aims to harvest Office365 credentials, masquerading as an Outlook Security update email from the IT Security department, which could bypass the SEG layer.\r\nIn the emails, the threat actor has spoofed both the sender and company names. Such use of personalized subject line and sender information increases the probability of the targeted users opening the attached PDF.  \r\nThe PDF carries links that would direct the victims to a website, which would ask either to download malware onto the victimâ€™s machine or the user to enter credentials.\r\nTo make the document look more legitimate, the attackers used the logos of Microsoft and the recipientâ€™s company and included details, such as release date.\r\nIn addition, it uses a reference of Google Ads service that redirects the users to another domain hxxp://ekavolunteers[.]org, and further to another domain pretending to be Microsoftâ€™s privacy policy page, designed to harvest credentials.\r\n\r\nRecent phishing attacks on Office 365\r\nSeveral attackers have been continuously attempting to lure Office 365 service users via various phishing campaigns.\r\nA few weeks ago, a phishing campaign was observed pretending to be Zix\'s online email authentication solution, that was targeting Office365 users to steal their credentials.

We all have logins for places we shop, so we can get emails about specials or limited time offers. Many of us have logins for our favorite food-ordering programs, car services, airline rewards programs and many more. In fact, many of us do not transact with an organization without setting up an account there.\r\n\r\nSo are fake accounts for these types of services a big concern? Why would it matter if the account didnâ€™t represent a one-to-one relationship with real people?\r\n\r\nThe answer: Fake account creation can result in massive fraud, a problem often minimized because everyone has encountered a fake account at one time or another.\r\n\r\nFor example, the U.S. Secret Service recently announced the return of roughly $2 billion in fraudulent unemployment requests. And the FCC recently found that 80 percent of the comments on net neutrality were fudged, with 7.7 million of the comments coming from a 19-year-old college student who fabricated peopleâ€™s names and addresses using software.\r\n\r\n\r\nFake-account generators.

Source: AIO Bot.\r\n\r\nAdditional fraudulent fake-account use extends deep into the retail world, where they are used heavily by â€œhype-saleâ€ bots in grabbing up highly desired items. Once a threat actor has created enough email addresses and â€œfarmedâ€ them to look like real people by sending emails, watching YouTube videos and in general, acting like a human, they then go set up accounts on the desired platforms for the purpose of making purchases of the next item to â€œdrop.â€ This means these platforms have hundreds of accounts that are simply controlled by the threat actor.\r\n\r\nWhen the drop happens, they are already logged in and hundreds of accounts attempt to checkout at once.  No wonder you canâ€™t buy that hot new pair of Yeezys, the latest game console, video card or package of toilet paper.\r\n\r\nBeing targeted by criminal organizations or individuals for fraud is something we all deal with from time to time, but online itâ€™s possible to be dealing with them in a near-constant stream. But the main issue with the phenomenon of fake accounts is the fact that, whether on a social-media platform, utilizing a public service or simply trying to buy a pair of sneakers, fake accounts are competing with your ability to be recognized as a real individual who desires to be heard.

According to Onapsis, a company that specializes in protecting business-critical applications, the flaw can be exploited by an attacker to upload script files, which suggests that it can be exploited for arbitrary code execution.\r\n\r\nThe second critical security hole, identified as CVE-2021-33690, has been described as a server-side request forgery (SSRF) affecting NetWeaver Development Infrastructure. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability for proxy attacks by sending specially crafted queries, and if the targeted instance is exposed to the internet, a hacker can “completely compromise sensitive data residing on the server, and impact its availability.”\r\n\r\nThe third critical vulnerability, CVE-2021-33701, is a SQL injection in the SAP NZDT (Near Zero Downtime Technology) service used by S/4HANA and the DMIS mobile plug-in.\r\n\r\nIt’s worth noting that SAP assigns a “Hot News” severity rating to critical vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe high-severity vulnerabilities patched by SAP include two cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws and an SSRF issue in NetWeaver Enterprise Portal. These vulnerabilities were discovered by researchers at Onapsis.\r\n\r\nAccording to the security firm, the XSS flaws impact two of the portal’s servlets and they allow an attacker to inject JavaScript code into the corresponding pages. The code is executed in the victim’s browser when they access the compromised servlet.\r\n\r\nAs for the SSRF bug, it allows an unauthenticated attacker to make requests to internal or external servers by getting the targeted user to click on a malicious link.\r\n\r\nOther vulnerabilities rated high severity include an authentication issue affecting all SAP systems accessed through a Web Dispatcher, a task hijacking issue in the Fiori Client mobile app for Android, and a missing authentication flaw in SAP Business One.\r\n\r\n“With nine critical patches in total (considering patches with HotNews and High Priority as critical), SAP customers are facing the most noteworthy SAP Patch Day this year.

This key is \'OgTD7co7NcYCoNj8NoYdPoR8nVFJBO5vs/kVkhelp2s=\', as shown below.\r\n\r\nWhen REvil ransomware victims pay a ransom, they receive either a decryptor that works for a single encrypted file extension or a universal decryptor that works for all encrypted file extensions used in a particular campaign or attack.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot above is for a universal REvil decryptor that can decrypt all extensions associated with the attack.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, while it was originally thought that the decryption key in this screenshot might be the master \'operator\' key for all REvil campaigns, BleepingComputer has confirmed that it is only the universal decryptor key for victims of the Kaseya attack.\r\n\r\nThis was also confirmed by Emsisoft CTO and ransomware expert Fabian Wosar.\r\n\r\nBleepingComputer tested the leaked key by patching an REvil universal decryptor with the decryption key leaked in the screenshot.\r\n\r\nAfter patching the decryptor, we encrypted a virtual machine with REvil ransomware samples used in the Kaseya attack.\r\n\r\nwe then used our patched REvil Universal Decryptor to decrypt the encrypted files successfully.\r\n\r\nSecurity firm Flashpoint also confirmed that they could decrypt files encrypted during the Kaseya ransomware attack using this decryption key.\r\n\r\nWe also tried the decryptor on other REvil samples we have accumulated over the past two years. The decryptor did not work, indicating it is not the master decryption key for all REvil victims.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear why the Kaseya decryptor was posted on a hacking forum, which is an unlikely place for a victim to post.\r\n\r\nHowever, BleepingComputer was told by numerous sources in the cybersecurity intelligence industry that they believe that the poster is affiliated with the REvil ransomware gang rather than a victim.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reasons for it being posted, for those following the Kaseya ransomware attack, this is our first access to the universal decryptor key that Kaseya mysteriously received.\"\r\n\r\n', 'news/images/30.png', '', '\r\n'),

Tuesday’s attack struck each chain consecutively, with the Poly team identifying three addresses where stolen assets were transferred.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Poly tweeted news of the attack, the three addresses collectively held more than $600 million in different cryptocurrencies, including USDC, wrapped bitcoin (WBTC, -1.94%), wrapped ether (ETH, -3.22%) and shiba inu (SHIB), blockchain scanning platforms show.\r\n\r\n“We call on miners of affected blockchain and crypto exchanges to blacklist tokens coming from the above addresses,” the Poly team tweeted.\r\n\r\nThe $600 million figure would place the Poly Network hack among the largest in crypto history.\r\n\r\nTether froze approximately $33 million in relation to the hack, Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino tweeted.\r\n\r\nAbout one hour after Poly announced the hack on Twitter, the hacker tried to move assets including USDT through the Ethereum address into liquidity pool Curve.fi, records show. The transaction was rejected.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, close to $100 million has been moved out of the Binance Smart Chain address in the past 30 minutes and deposited into liquidity pool Ellipsis Finance.\r\n\r\nThe Poly team could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.\r\n\r\nPoly Network was the second Chinese interoperability protocol to be featured on the government-backed Blockchain-based Service Network.\r\n\r\nAnatomy of an exploit\r\nBlockSec, a China-based blockchain security firm, said in an initial attack analysis report that the hack may be triggered by the leak of a private key that was used to sign the cross-chain message.\r\n\r\nBut it also added that another possible reason is a potential bug during Poly’s signing process that may have been “abused” to sign the message.\r\n\r\nAccording to another China-based blockchain security firm, Slowmist, the attackers’ original funds were in monero (XMR, -2.27%), a privacy-centric cryptocurrency, and were then exchanged for BNB, ETH, MATIC (-1.38%) and a few other tokens. \r\n\r\nThe attackers then initiated the attacks on Ethereum, BSC and Polygon blockchains. The finding was supported by Slowmist’s partners, including China-based exchange Hoo.\r\n\r\n“Based on the flows of the funds and multiple fingerprint information, it is likely a long-planned, organized, and well-prepared attack,” Slowmist wrote.\r\n\r\nIn a response to the attack, a spokesperson from Binance Smart Chain told CoinDesk that as a “decentralized” blockchain, protocols and users on BSC need to take security measures “extremely seriously.”\r\n\r\n“We are aware of the Poly exploit that has affected Ethereum, Polygon and BSC users,” the spokesperson said. “Recently, several trustless bridges have become victims of such critical attacks and we recommend security audits and necessary due diligence prior to interacting with any projects.”\r\n\r\nThe spokesperson said BSC is currently working with its security partners to provide as much support as possible to the ongoing investigation.\r\n\r\nThe Poly Network incident shows how nascent cross-chain protocols are particularly vulnerable to attacks. In July, cross-chain liquidity protocol Thorchain suffered two exploits in two weeks. Rari Capital, another cross-chain DeFi protocol, was hit by an attack in May, losing funds worth nearly $11 million in ETH.\r\n\r\n“As evidenced by all the exploits we’ve seen, cross-chain is a very hard area … with the added complexity of connections with every other chain and all their idiosyncrasies,” Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at blockchain data firm Messari, said.\"\r\n\r\n', 'news/images/31.png', '', '\r\n'),

None of the samples we found are known to XProtect since they do not match any of the scanner’s current set of Adload rules,\"\" Stokes concluded.\r\n\r\n\"\"The fact that hundreds of unique samples of a well-known adware variant have been circulating for at least 10 months and yet still remain undetected by Apple’s built-in malware scanner demonstrates the necessity of adding further endpoint security controls to Mac devices.\"\"\r\n\r\nHard to ignore threat\r\nTo put things into perspective, Shlayer, another common macOS malware strain that has also been able to bypass XProtect before and infect Macs with other malicious payloads, has hit over 10% of all Apple computers monitored by Kaspersky.\r\n\r\nIts creators also got their malware through Apple\'s automated notarizing process and included the ability to disable the Gatekeeper protection mechanism to run unsigned second-stage payloads.\r\n\r\nShlayer also recently exploited a macOS zero-day to bypass Apple\'s File Quarantine, Gatekeeper, and Notarization security checks and download second-stage malicious payloads on compromised Macs.\r\n\r\nWhile both AdLoad and Shlayer now only deploy adware and bundleware as secondary payloads, their creators can quickly switch to more dangerous malware, including ransomware or wipers, at any time.\r\n\r\n\"\"Today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and that is much worse than iOS,\"\" said Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software, under oath while testifying in the Epic Games vs. Apple trial in May.\"\r\n\r\n', 'news/images/34.png', '', '\r\n'),

The crypto-worm is based on XMRig and takes use of known web server flaws.\r\n(', '\r\n\"A new variant of the Golang crypto-worm was found dropping Monero-mining malware on targeted machines. The crypto-worm is based on XMRig and it abuses known web server vulnerabilities. Moreover, the payload binaries have the ability to speed up the mining process by 15%.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s new?\r\nResearchers from Uptycs have revealed that the worm scans for known vulnerabilities in Unix and Linux-based web servers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server or XML-RPC Server.\r\nCVE-2017-11610 is a remote execution flaw used to abuse XML-RPC, while CVE-2020-14882 is a path-traversal vulnerability used for abusing exposed Web Logic servers.\r\nIt looks like the attackers are attempting to bypass the authorization mechanism by modifying the URL and performing a path traversal (by exploiting CVE-2020-14882) with double encoding on /console/images.\r\nAfter exploiting the vulnerabilities, the attack uses a shell script (ldr.sh) that downloads the worm with curl utility. Additionally, the script uses evasion methods such as disabling monitoring agents or altering firewalls.\r\nThe first-stage worm is compiled in Golang and packed with UPX. The worm utilizes a go-bindata package to insert off-the-shelf XMRig cryptominer.\r\n\r\nAfter installation, the worm downloads an extra shell script to download a copy of the same worm. Subsequently, it installs XMRig into /tmp location and downloads a shell script on other exposed servers.\r\n\r\nModified XMRig targeting hardware for optimization\r\nIn this campaign, modified binaries of XMRig were used. The modified miner running with root privileges can disable the hardware prefetcher (processors prefetch data on basis of past access behavior of core) to boost the miner performance up to 15%.\r\nXMRig miners use the RandomX algorithm to produce various unique programs, which are created by data selected from the dataset produced from the hash of a key block.\r\nMemory intensive RandomX programs are executed within a VM. Therefore, the miner disables the hardware prefetcher by abusing the Model Specific Register (MSR), boosting its performance.\r\n\r\n', 'news/images/35.png', '', '\r\n'),

The flaws could allow intelligence harvesting simply by using a domain registration technique.\r\nHackers could intercept a small part of dynamic DNS traffic traveling via managed DNS providers such as Amazon and Google.\r\nTo exploit the flaw, attackers were required to register a domain and hijack a DNSaaS provider\'s nameserver to wiretap dynamic DNS traffic streaming from the targeted customer’s network.\r\nThe wiretapped dynamic DNS traffic was coming from more than 15,000 organizations, such as Fortune 500 firms, including 45 U.S. and 85 international government agencies.\r\nThis method allowed researchers to access a variety of data including sensitive information about target organizations, their employees. Even nation-state spying was possible.\r\n\r\nAdditional insights\r\nThere is no evidence that this vulnerability has ever been exploited in the wild by an attacker, however, any person with knowledge of the flaw could have obtained information for over a decade without being detected.\r\nExperts examined six major DNSaaS providers. Out of those, three were exposed to nameserver registration. \r\nAccording to the experts, all cloud providers, domain registrars, and website hosts providing DNSaaS could be vulnerable.\r\nMoreover, the exploitation of the vulnerability is so easy that an attacker with a single cloud account can obtain sensitive information from thousands of organizations.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nAccording to Microsoft, this flaw results due to some sort of misconfiguration issue with external DNS resolvers. There are mitigation steps available that can be followed by managed DNS services providers. Google and Amazon have fixed these DNS flaws, however, some other providers are still likely vulnerable and exposed.\"\r\n\r\n', 'news/images/36.png', '', '\r\n'),

This attack—Database Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression Heuristics (DBREACH)—could result in information disclosure and loss.\r\n\r\nAbout the attack\r\nDBREACH is considered to be the first compression side-channel attack on a database system. Using the DBREACH attack technique, an attacker can recover users’ encrypted data.\r\nDBREACH uses techniques similar to the Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME) attack. This attack, revealed in 2013, targets Transport Layer Security (TLS).\r\nResearchers claimed that several modern databases have data compression and encryption methods paired together to reduce costs. But this may expose the data for a new class of vulnerabilities known as side-channel attacks.\r\nDuring their research, the experts analyzed and applied their theory on the MariaDB open-source databases running with the InnoDB storage engine. According to them, the same techniques work on other databases as well.\r\n\r\nAttack methodology\r\nFor a DBREACH attack to be successful, an attacker requires the ability to insert/update a database table and estimate the size of a compressed table.\r\nThe database table can be either updated or inserted using a web interface. In addition, the attacker can obtain the required permissions with only a partial-select ability.\r\nEven without update permissions, the attacker can still force an update by rolling back the table file and performing an insert operation.\r\nMoreover, the size of the compressed table can be achieved by obtaining read access to the filesystem. With this, the attacker could read the size of the table.\r\n\r\nCautionary note\r\nResearchers claim that this threat model can result in real-world attacks. In order to mitigate the potential risks of the DBREACH attack, it is advisable for database administrators to avoid using column-level permission. Moreover, they can monitor the database usage patterns, such as DoS detection, and look for a single user with a sudden high number of updates.\"\r\n\r\n', 'news/images/37.png', '', '\r\n'),

Use common sense, assess the risks, choose, and take responsibility for your choice.\n\nNote that Iâ€™m just a developer, neither a security researcher nor an exploit writer, and my descriptions of security issues and their mitigations might fall between â€œslightly incorrectâ€ and â€œcompletely wrongâ€. I welcome corrections.\n\nmacOS 11â€™s better known security improvements\nAt the WWDC 2020, Apple made a big deal of several new macOS and iOS features that were, in fact, big deals. This article was supposed to come out much earlier, and I donâ€™t expect anyone still remembers what the fuss was about over a year later, so Iâ€™ll give you a brief recap.\n\nThe major new security features that would debut in macOS 11 were:\n\nPointer Authentication Codes (PAC), hardware-enforced Call Flow Integrity (CFI), implemented by Appleâ€™s homegrown 64 bit ARM processor, the M1. Currently limited to system code and kernel extensions, but open to all third-party developers for experimentation.\nDevice isolation was another M1-only feature, that uses the more powerful IOMMU of that platform to make sure hardware devices can only share memory with the operating system and not with each other. Cross-device memory sharing is a historical custom, based on a blind, unfounded trust in hardware.\nWrite XOR Execute (W^X) finally came to macOS, in a hardware-enforced form (yes, another M1-only feature). Memory pages can now be either writable or executable, never both at the same time; no exceptions. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers will need to be redesigned around this limitation to run on ARM Macs, but special APIs are provided to make the work easier.\nSigned System Volume (SSV) cryptographically sealed the boot volume and made it tamper-evident. (MacOS has booted from a read-only volume since 10.15.) Appleâ€™s Protecting data at multiple layers article briefly describes SSV, but Howard Oakley has an even more detailed write-up on his blog, with illustrations; a must-read. You should also check out Andrew Cunninghamâ€™s review of macOS 11.\nThese technologies have justly earned the attention of the press and security researchers, and theyâ€™ve been discussed in great detail elsewhere. (The Apple video Explore the new system architecture of Apple silicon Macs from session 10686 of the WWDC 2020 has a good overview of most of the new security features, and more.)\n\nThereâ€™s really nothing I could add to what the excellent resources out there say about these topics, but there are other security improvements that everyone seems to have missed, and that Apple seems to be shy about.\n\nSecret messages revealed?\nOn second thoughts, maybe my rummaging approach can add something novel (although incredibly trivial) to the publicly-disclosed security improvements: Iâ€™ve not seen anybody mention the fact that the cryptographically sealed filesystem underlying SSV is internally code-named â€œCryptexâ€. The cryptex(5) man page claims that: â€œThe name â€˜cryptexâ€™ is a portmanteau for â€˜CRYPTographically-sealed EXtensionâ€™.â€\n\nâ€¦ but I know, we know, they know that they took the name from Dan Brownâ€™s best-selling, award-winning birdcage liner The Da Vinci Code. The otherwise forgettable (and best-forgotten) airport thriller introduced the intriguing concept of a cryptex: a secret message, sealed by a combination lock, that would self-destruct if opened by force.\n\nThere are intriguing hints in cryptex(5) that suggest a wider Cryptex Cinematic Universe, like references to a cryptexctl(1) command and a cryptexd(8) daemon, but those man pages are nowhere to be found, nor are the two binaries part of macOS. A placeholder man page for libcryptex(3) has literally nothing to say about the â€œCryptex management libraryâ€, except an interesting detail: A copyright date of 19 October, 2018, suggesting that SSV had been in development for a long time before materializing as an end user feature.\n\nThe SDK includes the import libraries for libcryptex, libcryptex_core and libcryptex_interface, but not the libraries themselves, so we have the lists of exported symbols but not the code behind them. The libraries, too, are not part of macOS, which makes me think that the scattered Cryptex artefacts found in the SDK probably escaped, no idea how, from an Apple private code corral.\n\nAll that the symbol lists can tell us is that the politically correct â€œCRYPTographically-sealed EXtensionâ€ revisionism can be put to rest: To me, functions with names like codex_install_pack (exported by libcryptex_interface) unquestionably prove a Brownian origin of the name!\n\nCPU security mitigation APIs\nDevelopers are taught to think of the CPU as a perfect, mathematical abstraction. In 2018, year of microarchitectural vulnerabilities (Spectre and Meltdown to name the most infamous ones), we were set straight: CPUs run on code; CPU developers werenâ€™t preternaturally capable of writing multithreaded code without race conditions; and the CPUs they made were buggy, unreliable and traitorous, conspiring with applications against the operating system (OS) to bypass access controls in undetectable ways.\n\nThe issues that could be fixed were fixed. The remaining issues could only be mitigated, either in the OS or the compiler, at the the cost of performance. I was aware of the mitigations rolled out by Microsoft as Windows updates, the new MSVC compiler option /Qspectre, the changes to the Chrome JIT compiler to prevent it from generating exploitable code from malicious Javascript, etc.\n\nBut, I was surprised to discover new, unannounced, completely undocumented mitigations in macOS 11.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this is the first public article ever written that describes them. The new APIs return virtually no hits in grep.app or GitHub code searchâ€”or Google, for that matter.\n\nTwo kinds of mitigations are provided, codenamed NO_SMT and TECS. Letâ€™s have a closer look at them.\n\nThe NO_SMT mitigation\nWhat is it?\nNO_SMT disables Simultaneous multithreading (SMT), the CPU feature better known under Intelâ€™s trade name of â€œHyper-Threadingâ€. SMT allows a CPU core to execute two or more threads at the same time, for improved performance at the cost of contention for per-core resources, such as caches, TLBs etc.\n\nLetting multiple threads share invisible resources carries the risk of letting a malicious thread steal secrets from a â€œsiblingâ€ thread running on the same coreâ€”a risk that over the years has materialized into multiple attacks, like TLBleed, PortSmash, Fallout, ZombieLoad, RIDL. A straightforward mitigation for this entire family of attacks, past and future, is then to simply disable SMT, which is what NO_SMT does.\n\nHow to use NO_SMT\nIn C/C++, #include <libproc.h>; no extra library necessary. From <libproc.h>:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n/*\n * NO_SMT means that on an SMT CPU, this thread must be scheduled alone,\n * with the paired CPU idle.\n *\n * Set NO_SMT on the current proc (all existing and future threads)\n * This attribute is inherited on fork and exec\n */\nint proc_set_no_smt(void) __API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0));\n \n/* Set NO_SMT on the current thread */\nint proc_setthread_no_smt(void) __API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0));\nSimply call proc_set_no_smt to enable NO_SMT for the entire process (existing and future threads alike), or proc_setthread_no_smt to enable it for the calling thread only. Like the comments say, fork(2) children inherit the parent processâ€™s NO_SMT state, and exec(2) wonâ€™t reset it.\n\nNote that â€œlibprocâ€ is a misnomer, and these arenâ€™t library functions but thin C wrappers over the private system call process_policy(2).\n\nNO_SMT also extends posix_spawn(2), so that we can enable mitigations for a new process without setting them for the current process, or spawning a short-lived fork(2) child (ideally, we should never call fork(2) again in any new code, on any OS. Ever). From <spawn.h>:\n\n1\nint     posix_spawnattr_setnosmt_np(const posix_spawnattr_t * __restrict attr) __API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0));\nposix_spawnattr_setnosmt_np(3) performs the equivalent of proc_set_no_smt on the new process. In the name of the function, the â€œ_npâ€ suffix stands for â€œnon-portableâ€: A customary way to mark OS-specific extensions to posix_spawn(2).\n\nâ€œBut I already use fork(2) and I canâ€™t stop using it! How do I enable NO_SMT after exec(2) without enabling them for the fork child?â€ Youâ€™re in luck, because macOS has you covered: Any posix_spawn(2) feature is automatically available to exec(2) thanks to non-standard flag POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC, that can be set on a posix_spawnattr_t using posix_spawnattr_setflags(3), and makes posix_spawn(2) behave like exec(2), replacing the current process instead of creating a new one.\n\nHow does it work?\nNO_SMT is implemented as a per-task (not per-process[1]) flag, named TF_NO_SMT, or a per-thread scheduling flag named TH_SFLAG_NO_SMT. The flag is copied from tasks to their children, tasks and threads alike; itâ€™s a write-once flag, that once set cannot be removed. The flag is then copied from each thread to the CPU theyâ€™re currently running on (field processor_t::current_is_NO_SMT).\n\nNO_SMT is implemented by the dualq scheduling algorithm, in a pretty straightforward way: A NO_SMT thread cannot share a CPU core with any other thread.\n\nNO_SMT can be disabled system-wide with boot argument disable_NO_SMT_threads, which causes the kernel variable sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads to be initialized with 0 instead of 1. The current value of sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads can be queried with sysctl kern.sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads:\n\n1\n2\ntstudent@MAC-67C2FA8CA4EC ~ % sysctl kern.sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads\nkern.sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads: 1\nThe equivalent of NO_SMT can be forced on system-wide at the firmware level, by setting NVRAM variable SMTDisable to %01, as described in Apple support article HT210108.\n\nWhy you probably shouldnâ€™t use NO_SMT\nEnabling NO_SMT through the API, instead of configuring the firmware to boot the machine with SMT support disabled, provides limited protection, as the sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads variable is writable at runtime by the superuser:\n\n1\n2\n3\ntstudent@MAC-67C2FA8CA4EC ~ % sudo sysctl kern.sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads=0\nPassword:\nkern.sched_allow_NO_SMT_threads: 1 -&gt; 0\nThis instantly disables NO_SMT system-wide. I wonder why they bothered making it a write-once flag, only to make it so trivial to disable.\n\nThe TECS mitigation\nWhat is it?\nI have been unable to figure out what TECS stands for. Closest I could get was this comment from the source code of the kernel (osfmk/kern/task.h, from XNU 7195.50.7.100.1):\n\n1\n#define TF_TECS                 0x00020000                              /* task threads must enable CPU security */\nThread Enable CPU Security? Even if itâ€™s the correct interpretation, it doesnâ€™t help us understand what it does.\n\nIn its current incarnation (the generic name suggests the specifics might change in the future), TECS flushes certain internal CPU buffers before returning from kernel mode to user mode. Itâ€™s a mitigation for the Rogue Data Cache Load (RDCL) family of attacks (like Meltdown) and the Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) family of attacks (like RIDL and Fallout).\n\nHow to use TECS\nUnlike NO_SMT, TECS doesnâ€™t have a dedicated API, but itâ€™s enabled through a generic API called CPU Security Mitigations (CSM), that can also enable NO_SMT. In C/C++, #include <libproc.h>; no extra library necessary. From <libproc.h>:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n/*\n * CPU Security Mitigation APIs\n *\n * Set CPU security mitigation on the current proc (all existing and future threads)\n * This attribute is inherited on fork and exec\n */\nint proc_set_csm(uint32_t flags) __API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0));\n \n/* Set CPU security mitigation on the current thread */\nint proc_setthread_csm(uint32_t flags) __API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0));\n \n/*\n * flags for CPU Security Mitigation APIs\n * PROC_CSM_ALL should be used in most cases,\n * the individual flags are provided only for performance evaluation etc\n */\n#define PROC_CSM_ALL         0x0001  /* Set all available mitigations */\n#define PROC_CSM_NOSMT       0x0002  /* Set NO_SMT - see above */\n#define PROC_CSM_TECS        0x0004  /* Execute VERW on every return to user mode */\nAs with the dedicated NO_SMT API, we can enable mitigations for the entire current process, using proc_set_csm, or just the calling thread, with proc_setthread_csm. CSM functions, too, are wrappers for process_policy(2).\n\nFinally, just like NO_SMT, CSM also extends posix_spawn(2). From <spawn.h>:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n/*\n * Set CPU Security Mitigation on the spawned process\n * This attribute affects all threads and is inherited on fork and exec\n */\nint     posix_spawnattr_set_csm_np(const posix_spawnattr_t * __restrict attr, uint32_t flags) __API_AVAILABLE(macos(11.0));\n/*\n * flags for CPU Security Mitigation attribute\n * POSIX_SPAWN_NP_CSM_ALL should be used in most cases,\n * the individual flags are provided only for performance evaluation etc\n */\n#define POSIX_SPAWN_NP_CSM_ALL         0x0001\n#define POSIX_SPAWN_NP_CSM_NOSMT       0x0002\n#define POSIX_SPAWN_NP_CSM_TECS        0x0004\nThe meaning of the flags is identical to the similarly named <libproc.h> flags, and posix_spawnattr_set_csm_np(attr, POSIX_SPAWN_NP_CSM_NOSMT) is 100% identical to and interchangeable with posix_spawnattr_setnosmt_np(attr).\n\nHow does it work?\nJust like NO_SMT, TECS is a write-once, enable-only flag that is copied from task to task, from task to thread, and from thread to CPU. The task flag is TF_TECS. Below the task level, the flag becomes architecture-specific, x86-64-only, morphing into a mitigation codenamed SEGCHK. Thus, the thread flag is boolean field machine_thread::mthr_do_segchk, and the CPU flag is boolean field cpu_data::cpu_curthread_do_segchk, also known as CPU_NEED_SEGCHK in assembler code.\n\nSEGCHK is implemented entirely in assembler, in kernel-to-user return routines ks_64bit_return and ks_32bit_return. If CPU_NEED_SEGCHK is set for the current CPU, they execute a VERW instruction shortly before the final SYSEXIT/SYSRET/IRET. VERW is an obscure and largely obsolete instruction that checks if the specified segment (the user mode stack segment, in the case of SEGCHK) is writable; but more importantly, it has the side effect of flushing the caches exploited by the RDCL and MDS families of attacks, mitigating them.\n\nTECS is only enabled if itâ€™s supported by the CPU, or if itâ€™s been forced on by default. CPU support for TECS is only checked on x86-64, and it corresponds to whether SEGCHK is supported. The checks, performed at boot time, are:\n\nBy default, SEGCHK is off.\nIf the CPU has the IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR, itâ€™s checked for the RDCL_NO and MDS_NO capabilities. If either is set, the vulnerabilities are assumed to have been fixed at the microcode level, and SEGCHK stays off.\nIf the CPU has the MD_CLEAR feature, its VERW instruction was specifically enhanced to mitigate RDCL and MDS issues, and SEGCHK is on.\nUsing VERW as a mitigation was initially suggested by two of the discoverers of RIDL (page 200), but it seems it proved insufficient, and CPU vendors had to enhance the instruction to act as a proper mitigation. macOS doesnâ€™t trust the un-enhanced VERW.\n\nSEGCHK can be forced on system-wide with a boot parameter. Again, see support article HT210108. Similarly, it can be forced off system-wide with undocumented boot parameter cwad (CPU workaround disable), which has the same syntax as cwae (CPU workaround enable). cwae has priority over cwad.\n\nUnlike NO_SMT, SEGCHK/TECS has no firmware-level equivalent, nor can it be disabled after boot.\n\nWho benefits from NO_SMT and TECS?\nGoogle.\n\nIâ€™ve looked everywhere and no one else seems to use these mitigation APIs. The only source code match (outside of the macOS 11 and 12 SDKs, and the XNU source code itself) is Chromium. The only binary matches on my macOS 11 machine (outside of system libraries) are the Chrome and Electron frameworks, i.e. Chromium. Not even Safari seems to use them!\n\nIn Chromium, when compiling for macOS, the base::LaunchOptions structure passed to function base::LaunchProcess contains a boolean field named enable_cpu_security_mitigations; if set, the macOS implementation of base::LaunchProcess launches the new process with CSM flags POSIX_SPAWN_NP_CSM_ALL. If I understand the code correctly, mitigations are enabled for renderer and plugin host sub-processes, and disabled for all other kinds of sub-processes (another possible reading of the code suggests that the feature is implemented, but unused. Honestly, I havenâ€™t dug too deep).\n\nItâ€™s hard not to wonder why Apple went through the effort of implementing mitigations and exposing them as APIs, and then neither document nor even use them. If they are ineffective, the question becomes why Google bothers using them. Either way, we are left with no clear answer.\n\nEndpoint Security API improvements\nEndpoint Security probably needs no introduction to the audience of this article, but Iâ€™ll still give a brief one.\n\nThis C API, first introduced in macOS 10.15, replaced and made obsolete the pre-existing patchwork of archaic auditing, monitoring and policing APIs (among which OpenBSM, KAUTH, Socketfilter and the venerable acct(2)â€”est. 1979[2]).\n\nThe design of Endpoint Security combined the near-absolute visibility and veto power over system state of a MAC[3] policy module with the safety properties of a client-server model, with a really nice and pretty-well-documented API on top. In short, it was the perfect API for a large variety of security applications.\n\nOr was it? Unfortunately, Endpoint Security wasnâ€™t without its own shortcomings, but theyâ€™re gradually being rectified. Letâ€™s have a look at the most important improvements that macOS 11 and 12 make to Endpoint Security, only some of which were officially documented.\n\nMore message types\nMore operations can now be detected and/or vetoed, such as fcntl(2), searchfs(2), ptrace(2), remounting a filesystem, IOServiceOpen, task_name_for_pid, process suspension and process resumption.\n\nInterestingly, process suspension includes private system call pid_shutdown_sockets, which doesnâ€™t actually suspend processes, but only shuts down their network connections after theyâ€™ve already been suspended. The system call was originally only available on iOS, where itâ€™s part of how apps are sent to the background.\n\nmacOS 12 adds some more notifications: setuid(2), setgid(2), seteuid(2), setegid(2), setreuid(2) and setregid(2).\n\nMore notifications, less polling\nSome process metadata that only used to be available for querying, and necessitated polling and/or diffing to detect changes, now generates change events.\n\nES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_CS_INVALIDATED messages notify that a processâ€™s code signature has gone invalid (i.e. CS_VALID flag no longer set) but the process is allowed to keep running (i.e. CS_HARD flag not set). Previously, it was only pollable through private system calls csops or csops_audittoken with operation code CS_OPS_STATUS.\n\nES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_REMOTE_THREAD_CREATE messages notify the creation of remote (i.e. inter-process) threads. Previously, this information was only available at low fidelity and with great effort, either by polling and diffing the data returned by Mach task method task_info with flavor TASK_EXTMOD_INFO, or by monitoring syslog for com.apple.kernel.external_modification messages.\n\nMore metadata\nexec(2) messages now include the new processâ€™s working directory (es_event_exec_t::cwd field).\n\nProcess metadata for all messages now includes:\n\nThe processâ€™s controlling terminal, if any (es_process_t::tty field).\nThe processâ€™s â€œstart timeâ€, i.e. the time when its process identifier was allocated by fork(2) (es_process_t::start_time field). Previously only available through sysctl(2) with the kern.proc.pid.<process identifier> OID.\nthe â€œresponsible processâ€ (es_process_t::responsible_audit_token field), i.e. the process that the notorious (to us developers) Transparency, Consent & Control (TCC) framework blames for an operation subject to user consent. Often, this is the client process that caused a daemon/agent process to be launched, which in an auditing context should be considered the â€œtrueâ€ parent of a process (instead of â€œplaceholderâ€ xpcproxy(8)). Previously only available through the privateâ€”and completely undocumentedâ€”â€responsibilityâ€ API of MAC policy module Quarantine (e.g. responsibility_get_responsible_for_pid).\nFinally, for the first time ever in a macOS auditing API, all messages now report not just the process that caused the message to be generated, but the exact thread as well (es_message_t::thread field).\n\nImproved performance\nItâ€™s now possible to process messages asynchronously without the overhead of es_copy_message/es_free_message (equivalent to a sequence of malloc, memcpy and free): Messages are now reference counted (see new functions es_retain_message/es_release_message), and can be moved across threads almost for free. es_copy_message and es_free_message have been outright deprecated and should no longer be used, except for backwards compatibility with macOS 10.15. They wonâ€™t be missed by me or my spindump traces.\n\nA vulnerability quietly fixed\nSometimes, diffing SDK versions can even reveal security holes that were quietly fixed. Such is the case for fcntl(2) command F_SETSIZE.\n\nF_SETSIZE is used to change the maximum disk space allocated to a file: If itâ€™s smaller than the current size, the file is truncated; if itâ€™s larger, the file is extended. What stops a malicious process from extending a file so that it fills the entire disk, and then reading from the extended file to carve deleted files out of what was previously free space? Very simple: F_SETSIZE fills the new file space with all zeroes to conceal what it used to contain. As an optimization, a superuser process (effective user id 0) is allowed to extend a file without zeroing out, because a superuser process is assumed to have access to that data anyway.\n\nHowever, macOS has gradually made the UNIX security model irrelevant. For example, even the superuser is only allowed to access the private documents of a regular user with the userâ€™s permissionâ€”permission that is given on a per-application basis, through that protector of users and bane of developers known as the Transparency, Consent & Control (TCC) framework. This reflects the new meaning that macOS has given to the â€œrootâ€ superuser: No longer the administrator of a multi-user system, as it was originally meant on UNIX, but either a temporary identity assumed by each user for system administration tasks (e.g. by way of sudo(8)), or the anonymous user under which daemons run[4].\n\nIn this new security model, the superuser can no longer be assumed to have unrestricted access to everything. However, not zeroing space when extending a file would let a superuser process with no entitlements at all recover any file that had been deleted.\n\nmacOS 11 fixes this by no longer handling the superuser as a special case for F_SETSIZE. The man page for fcntl(2) now says:\n\nF_SETSIZE . Deprecated. In previous releases, this would allow a process with root privileges to truncate a file without zeroing space. For security reasons, this operation is no longer supported and will instead truncate the file in the same manner as truncate(2).\n\nEven the comments in <sys/fcntl.h> were amended. Before (macOS 10.15 SDK):\n\n1\n#define F_SETSIZE       43              /* Truncate a file without zeroing space */\nAnd after (macOS 11 SDK):\n\n1\n#define F_SETSIZE       43              /* Truncate a file. Equivalent to calling truncate(2) */\nAs far as I can tell, this information disclosure vulnerability was never assigned a CVE, nor was it publicly acknowledged in any other way before it was silently fixed in macOS 11.\n\nO_NOFOLLOW_ANY\nEven primeval APIs like system call open(2) can still have room for improvement. macOS 11 introduces a new flag for it, O_NOFOLLOW_ANY, that mitigates an entire family of potential vulnerabilities, especially in security applications.\n\nEndpoint Security provides the full, resolved (no symlinks), normalized path of each file involved in an auditable event (what OpenBSM veterans/victims like me used to know as â€œvnode kpathâ€), but how can applications be sure that the path still identifies the same file by the time they open it? With O_NOFOLLOW_ANY set, open(2) will fail with error ELOOP if any symlink is encountered anywhere in the path: A stronger version of O_NOFOLLOW that applies to the entire path, not just the final component.\n\nConclusion\nWhat did I learn from my rummaging? Apple still likes its secrets; the Chromium source code still is the best documentation on the mitigations and sandboxing features provided by all major operating systems; diffing releases remains the best way to find hidden features; and some secrets can stay hidden in plain sight for a long time.\n\nI wrote this article in part as a â€œlook at this cool thingâ€, and in part as a sort of public service, so that the new, hidden macOS features no longer return a deafening silence when queried on search engines. Even if I got some details wrong, at least the topic can now be debated.\n\nEndnotes\n1 The relationship between tasks and processes in macOS can be roughly summarized as: Each (BSD) process corresponds exactly to one (Mach[5]) task, and vice versa, until the process calls exec(2). exec(2) terminates the current task, creates a new one and associates it to the process, replacing the dead one. macOS old timers may object that exec(2) actually keeps the same task, resetting its state. It used to work like that, but it was a fragile design, that was dealt a fatal blow by Google researcher Ian Beer in 2016. Starting from XNU 3789.21.4 (macOS 10.12.1, iOS 10.1), exec(2) creates a new task.\n\n2 Whatâ€™s the use for such an ancient API? It may sound incredible, but until Endpoint Security, macOS had no reliable auditing mechanism to log process deaths. Except acct(2), that is, which to describe as â€œarchaicâ€ would be a compliment. It logs fixed-size records to a global log file, it truncates process names to 9 characters, it logs user ids but not process ids, and the timestamp format for process exit times is a literally unbelievable 1/64 * 8^exponent * mantissa seconds since the process started (good for about 8 years and a half of non-stop running, but with a variable precision that drops below the second at the 2:16:30 mark), encoded in 16 bits as 3 bits exponent, 13 bits mantissa; the process start time is a saner 32-bit count of seconds since the UNIX epoch (good for about 17 years from now). We opted not to use acct(2).\n\n3 Mandatory Access Control, no relation to â€œMacâ€ as an abbreviation for â€œMacintoshâ€. Historically referring to security models patterned after military document classification practices, MAC is nowadays a generic term for any policy-based security model, distinct from and orthogonal to permission-based security models (also known as DAC, or Discretionary Access Control). macOS inherited its modular MAC framework from the TrustedBSD project and uses it with great gusto (I count no fewer than seven policy modules on my macOS 11 machine). The Linux Security Modules framework is the Linux equivalent. Windows has limited MAC in the form of the capabilities system for UWP apps. The bitter irony is that, being limited to a small subset of applications, itâ€™s a â€œmandatoryâ€ access control system that operates on an opt-in basisâ€”to say nothing of its complete non-extensibility.\n\n4 If daemons have to run under an anonymous user, why must it be root, which, while still bound by MAC policies, can bypass all ACLs, send kill signals to any process, invoke sysctls in write mode and in general do a lot of damage? A little known fact is that while system daemons run as root, they also do run inside extremely strict sandboxes based on the Seatbelt framework (internally based on, you guessed it, a MAC policy module, unimaginatively named Sandbox). In a sadly predictable twist, while extremely powerful and enabling incredibly granular access control, Seatbelt is almost completely undocumented (notice a pattern yet?). In a less predictable but sadder twist, itâ€™s also been marked as deprecated with no replacement since OS X 10.8. Nevertheless, with all system daemons using it, plus third-party users of the caliber of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, Seatbelt seems unlikely to disappear any time soon.\n\n5 Mach (no relation to â€œMacintoshâ€) was a research project to replace the BSD kernel with a microkernel. The design proved impractical, and the most famous real-world implementation of Mach, NeXTSTEP (later â€œDarwinâ€, later â€œOS Xâ€, later â€œmacOSâ€), actually runs a Mach/BSD hybrid kernel with very little â€œmicroâ€. Mach was an extremely influential design: Windows NT (later â€œWindowsâ€) is a Mach clone too, except redesigned to work alongside a VMS-like kernel instead of a BSD one. Windows NT, too, flirted with a microkernel architecture, but it proved to be no more practical in the 90s than it had been in the 80s.', 'news/images/53.png', '', '<br/>'),

Another 7.8 million are current â€œpostpaidâ€ customers, which just means T-Mobile customers who get billed at the end of each month. Those roughly 48 million users had their full names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and driverâ€™s license information stolen. An additional 850,000 prepaid customersâ€”who fund their accounts in advanceâ€”had their names, phone numbers, and PINs exposed. The investigation is ongoing, which means that the tally may not stop there.\n\nThereâ€™s no good news here, but the slightly less bad news is that the vast majority of customers appear not to have had their phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information taken in the breach. The bigger question, though, is whether T-Mobile really needed to hold on to such sensitive information from 40 million people with whom it doesnâ€™t currently do businesses. Or if the company was going to stockpile that data, why it didnâ€™t take better precautions to protect it.\n\nâ€œGenerally speaking, itâ€™s still the Wild West in the United States when it comes to the types of information companies can keep about us,â€ says Amy Keller, a partner at the law firm DiCello Levitt Gutzler who led the class action lawsuit against Equifax after the credit bureauâ€™s 2017 breach. â€œIâ€™m surprised and Iâ€™m also not surprised. I guess you could say Iâ€™m frustrated.â€\n\nPrivacy advocates have long promoted the concept of data minimization, a fairly self-explanatory practice that encourages companies to hold on to as little information as necessary. Europeâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation codifies the practice, requiring that personal data be â€œadequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.â€ The US currently has no equivalent on the books. â€œPrivacy laws in the United States that do touch upon data minimization generally donâ€™t require it,â€ Keller says, â€œand instead recommend it as a best practice.â€\n\nUntil and unless the US adopts an omnibus privacy law similar to the GDPRâ€”or state-level legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act starts taking a harder lineâ€”data minimization will remain a foreign concept. â€œIn general, collecting and retaining sensitive data of prospective and former customers is not an act of consumer fraud under US law, and is routine,â€ says David Opderbeck, codirector of Seton Hall Universityâ€™s Institute of Law, Science and Technology. As inappropriate as it may seem for T-Mobile to keep detailed records on millions of people who may never have been their customers, thereâ€™s nothing stopping it from doing so, for as long as it likes.\n\nNow those former and prospective customers, along with millions of current T-Mobile subscribers, find themselves victims of a data breach they had no control over. â€œThe first risk is identity theft,â€ says John LaCour, founder and CTO of digital risk protection company PhishLabs. â€œThe information includes names, social security numbers, driverâ€™s license IDs: all the information that would be required to apply for credit as someone.â€\n\nThe hack would also potentially make it easier to pull off so-called SIM swap attacks, LaCour says, particularly against the prepaid customers who had their PINs and phone numbers exposed. In a SIM swap, a hacker ports your number to their own device, typically so that they can intercept SMS-based two-factor authentication codes, making it easier to break into your online accounts. T-Mobile did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED as to whether International Mobile Equipment Identity numbers were also implicated in the breach; each mobile device has a unique IMEI that would also be of value to SIM-swappers.\n\nT-Mobile has implemented a few precautions on behalf of victims. Itâ€™s offering two years of identity protection services from McAfeeâ€™s ID Theft Protection Service, and it has already reset the PINs of the 850,000 prepaid customers who had theirs exposed. Itâ€™s recommending but not mandating that all current postpaid customers change their PINs as well, and it is offering a service called Account Takeover Protection to help stymie SIM-swap attacks. It also plans to publish a site for â€œone-stop informationâ€ Wednesday, although the company didn\'t say if it would offer any kind of lookup to see if youâ€™re affected by the breach.\n\n\nInstead, T-Mobile says it will rely on proactive outreach to victims. The carrier didnâ€™t respond to an inquiry from WIRED as to what if any specific plans it had for that communication, and what specific information theyâ€™ll be sharing with people whose data was compromised. Even sharing something as simple as a timetable would help, LaCour says, so that people could know theyâ€™re in the clear if they havenâ€™t been a T-Mobile customer for a certain number of years.\n\nIn the meantime, if youâ€™re a current T-Mobile customer you should go ahead and change your PIN and password; you can do so from your T-Mobile account online. You should take the free two years of ID monitoring, although itâ€™s not yet clear how that will work in practice. You should start using app-based two-factor authentication wherever possible, rather than receiving those codes by text. For a more extreme but still prudent precaution, you can contact the three major credit bureaus and request a freeze on your credit report, which would stop anyone from accessing it or opening new accounts in your name.\n\nBecause the US lacks a comprehensive cybersecurity law, agencies like the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission have limited ways to apply pressure, says Seton Hallâ€™s Opderbeck, although the incident has already attracted FCC scrutiny. â€œTelecommunications companies have a duty to protect their customersâ€™ information,â€ an agency spokesperson said in an emailed statement. â€œThe FCC is aware of reports of a data breach affecting T-Mobile customers and we are investigating.â€\n\nIf T-Mobile does face repercussions for the breachâ€”its sixth in four yearsâ€”it would more likely come from a class action lawsuit. Opderbeck says that his research has shown more than 30 data breach settlements in the last few years that resulted in a small cash payout and free credit monitoring as restitution. And Keller notes that even the class action route may be difficult to travel, because of a clause in T-Mobile contracts that can force customers into arbitration.\n\nItâ€™s not realistic to expect every company to stop every breach, especially when those companies posses data highly valuable to hackers. But it is reasonable to hope that a business in that position would take every care to limit the impact of those compromises. Keeping detailed records of more than 40 million former or prospective customersâ€”including their social security numbers and driverâ€™s license informationâ€”seems needlessly reckless. After all, nobody can steal what isnâ€™t there in the first place.', 'news/images/57.png', '', '<br/>');

Fortinet provides FortiWeb as a SaaS offering as well hardware WAFs with various network capacities.\n\nAccording to Rapid7â€™s William Wu, the SAML configuration page of FortiWeb had a command injection vulnerability that allowed attackers to embed arbitrary system commands in web requests.\n\nThese commands would then be executed as the root user on the operating system running FortiWeb.\n\nAuthentication required\nA proof of concept shows how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by adding a backtick and an arbitrary command to an HTTP request.\n\nThe vulnerability is only accessible to authenticated parties, so an adversary would need to gain access to the administratorâ€™s credentials before staging the attack.\n\nHowever, once the device is compromised, the attacker can leverage the vulnerability to control the affected device â€œwith the highest possible privilegesâ€, according to Rapid7.\n\nâ€œThe disclosed FortiWeb issue is essentially a privilege escalation from â€˜Fortiweb userâ€™ to â€˜Operating System root,â€™ so an attacker who already has a method for being authenticated can take control of the underlying machine that is running the Fortiweb application,â€ Tod Beardsley, director of research at Rapid7, told The Daily Swig.\n\n\nRead more of the latest infosec research news\n\n\nâ€œ[The attacker] might install a persistent shell, crypto-mining software, or other malicious software,â€ Rapid7 wrote in its advisory.\n\nIf the deviceâ€™s management interface is exposed to the internet, the attacker could use the compromised platform to reach into the affected network beyond the secured perimeter.\n\nRapid7â€™s researchers found less than 300 FortiWeb devices that had their management interface accessible through the general internet.\n\nPatch incoming\nFortinet will patch the bug in the next version of FortiWeb (6.4.1), which according to Rapid7 will be released later in August.\n\nIn the meantime, Rapid7 advises administrators to make FortiWebâ€™s device management interface inaccessible to untrusted networks, including the general internet.\n\nâ€œGenerally speaking, management interfaces for devices like FortiWeb should not be exposed directly to the internet anyway.\n\nâ€œIn nearly all cases, this is a bad idea, since it opens up a whole bunch of attack surfaces to strangers on the internet, often for no real reason or upside,â€ Beardsley warned. â€œWeb management consoles should really only be exposed to trusted networks, so internal-only or over VPN.â€\n\n', 'news/images/58.png', '', '<br/>'),

The vulnerable plugin is installed on 100,000 websites.\n\nA stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SEOPress WordPress plugin could allow attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into websites, researchers said.\n\nSEOPress is a search engine optimization (SEO) tool that lets site owners manage SEO metadata, social-media cards, Google Ad settings and more. Itâ€™s installed on more than 100,000 sites.\n\nâ€œOne feature the plugin implements is the ability to add a SEO title and description to posts, and this can be done while saving edits to a post or via a newly introduced REST-API endpoint,â€ researchers at Wordfence said in a Monday blog post. â€œUnfortunately, this REST-API endpoint was insecurely implemented.â€\n\nInfosec Insiders Newsletter\n\nThe bug (CVE-2021-34641) allows any authenticated user, like a subscriber, to call the REST route with a valid nonce, and to update the SEO title and description for any post.\n\nâ€œThe permissions_callback for the endpoint only verified if the user had a valid REST-API nonce in the request,â€ according to the posting. â€œA valid REST-API nonce can be generated by any authenticated user using the rest-nonce WordPress core AJAX action.â€\n\nDepending on what an attacker updates the title and description to, it would allow a number of malicious actions, up to and including full site takeover, researchers said.\n\nâ€œThe payload could include malicious web scripts, like JavaScript, due to a lack of sanitization or escaping on the stored parameters,â€ they wrote. â€œThese web scripts would then execute any time a user accessed the â€˜All Postsâ€™ page.

That\'s because web security researchers are concerned about malicious actors compromising a website from the outside.\n\nAccordingly, many recent security upgrades to web protocols and browsers are centered on preventing cross-site attacks while placing more trust on sites that share a domain.\n\nSome of these security-focused upgrades include SameSite cookies, Site Isolation, and HTTP cache partitioning.\n\n\nRELATED Browser security briefing: Google and Mozilla lay the groundwork for a â€˜post-XSS worldâ€™\n\n\nâ€œThe same-site security boundary is becoming more and more relevant,â€ Marco Squarcina, postdoctoral researcher at TU Wien, told The Daily Swig.\n\nâ€œThis inherent trust in same-site content inspired us to evaluate the presence of same-site threats and understand the security import on web applications.â€\n\nTaking over subdomains\nSquarcina and his colleagues investigated how attackers can enter the trust zones of targeted websites in order to attack them.\n\nKnown as â€˜related-domain attackersâ€™, these adversaries operate a malicious website that is hosted on a domain that shares a suffix with that of the target website.\n\nAttackers can exploit DNS misconfigurations to hijack subdomains that are considered as trusted by the target website.\n\n\nRead more of the latest security research news\n\n\nIn their paper, the researchers list possible causes of subdomain takeover. One key vulnerability vector is dangling DNS records, records in the authoritative DNS servers of a domain that point to expired resources that can be acquired by an adversary.\n\nâ€œThe most common cause of a takeover vulnerability is due to dangling records,â€ Squarcina said.\n\nâ€œAs an example, consider a subdomain of example.org, like foo.example.org, pointing to an expired domain name (e.g., fooexample.org) via a CNAME DNS entry. Attackers could simply register fooexample.org to fully control the page served at foo.example.org.â€\n\nIn their paper, the researchers also explore subdomain hijacking on corporate networks and roaming services, hosting providers and dynamic DNS services, and compromised hosts and websites.\n\nRelated-domain attacks\nA successful subdomain takeover can lead to an array of threats, including phishing and malware distribution, Site Isolation protection circumvention, same-site request forgery, cookie confidentiality bypassing, Content Security Policy bypassing, and cross-origin resource-sharing abuse.\n\nâ€œThe privileged position controlled by RDAs enables a set of exclusive XSS, CSRF, Session Hijacking, and SOP bypass attacks that are not available to a standard web attacker,â€ Squarcina said.\n\nâ€œFor instance, the SameSite cookie attribute is an effective countermeasure against CSRF attacks, but it does not apply to requests originating from a page that is cross-origin but same-site to the target application.â€\n\nVulnerable domains\nIn their research, Squarcina and his colleagues examined the top 50,000 domains in the Tranco list.\n\nAccording to their findings, 15% of large domains (more than 50,000 subdomains) were vulnerable.\n\nThe researchers found subdomain takeover vulnerabilities on news websites like cnn.com and time.com, university portals like harvard.edu and mit.edu, government websites like europa.eu and nih.gov, and IT companies like lenovo.com and cisco.com.\n\nInterestingly, most of the discovered vulnerabilities could be fixed by routinely checking the validity of DNS records, which speaks to how little attention domain-related attacks are getting.\n\nâ€œOverall, we identified 887 sites among the top 50,000 with takeover vulnerabilities,â€ Squarcina said.\n\nâ€œThis is, however, an under-approximation that does not take into account vulnerabilities caused by deprovisioned cloud resources. Therefore, we estimate takeover vulnerabilities to be even more pervasive than captured by these numbers.â€\n\n', 'news/images/60.png', '', '<br/>'),

This is a virus family that has been spreading with increasing fr', 'Recently, a new threat, referred to as \"SQUIRRELWAFFLE\" is being spread more widely via spam campaigns, infecting systems with a new malware loader. This is a malware family that\'s been spread with increasing regularity and could become the next big player in the spam space.\n\nSQUIRRELWAFFLE provides threat actors with an initial foothold onto systems and their network environments that can then be used to facilitate further compromise or additional malware infections depending on how adversaries choose to attempt to monetize their access. In many cases, these infections are also being used to deliver and infect systems with other malware like Qakbot and the penetration-testing tool Cobalt Strike. Let\'s take a look at how this new threat operates and the volume and characteristics of the malicious email campaigns associated with it. Organizations should be aware of this threat, as it will likely persist across the threat landscape for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nEmail campaigns\n\nThe email threat landscape is constantly changing as new threats emerge or existing threats evolve over time. Over the past few years, Emotet has been one of the primary threats being delivered via malicious spam campaigns as we have previously described in detail several times. Following law enforcement disruption of the Emotet botnets, we\'ve been waiting for another threat to fill the void left by Emotet\'s exit.\n\nBeginning in mid-September 2021, we observed malspam campaigns being used to deliver malicious Microsoft Office documents that function as the initial stage of the infection process and are used to infect systems with SQUIRRELWAFFLE. Similar to what has been observed in previous threats like Emotet, these campaigns appear to be leveraging stolen email threads, as the emails themselves appear to be replies to existing email threads. As shown below, these emails typically contain hyperlinks to malicious ZIP archives being hosted on attacker-controlled web servers. \n\n The language targeted by the reply messages typically matches the language used in the original email thread, demonstrating that there is some localization taking place dynamically. While the majority of the emails were written in English, the use of other languages across these campaigns highlight that this threat is not limited to a specific geographic region. Across the malicious email campaigns we have observed being used to deliver SQUIRRELWAFFLE, the top five languages used are as follows:\n\n Consistent with other threats also leveraging stolen email threads, we observed some inconsistencies in how the attacker chooses which email chains to hijack. In the following example, the attacker was observed replying to an extortion email message, which is likely ineffective in convincing the recipient to access the content in the body of the email.\n\n Since the emergence of SQUIRRELWAFFLE, we have observed steady malicious email campaign activity associated with this threat. Below is a graph illustrating the volumetric trajectory of these campaigns between Sept. 1 and Oct. 15, 2021.\n\nWhile the volume associated with these campaigns is not yet reaching the same level seen previously with threats like Emotet, it appears to be fairly consistent and may increase over time as the adversaries infect more users and increase the size of their botnet. The campaigns themselves feature several similar characteristics to the campaigns previously seen associated with established threats like Emotet. Due to the prevalence of these campaigns, organizations should be aware of SQUIRRELWAFFLE and the way it could be used by attackers to further compromise corporate networks.\n\nIn all of these cases, the emails are designed to trick the potential victim into accessing the included hyperlink to download a malicious ZIP archive. Malicious Microsoft Office files are inside the archives, which initiate the infection process as described below.\n\nInfection process\n\nWhen the victim accesses the hyperlink contained in the initial malicious spam message, they are sent a ZIP archive containing a malicious Office document. While these documents have varied across campaigns, in all cases, they are either Microsoft Word documents or Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. These documents contain the malicious code responsible for retrieving and executing the next stage component, in this case, the SQUIRRELWAFFLE payload.\n\nAcross all of the malspam campaigns observed, the distribution of DOC versus XLS was roughly 50/50.\n\n In all of the campaigns observed, the distribution URLs that are used to host the malicious ZIP archives contain Latin words and follow a URL structure similar to the following example:\n\nabogados-en-medellin[.]com/odit-error/assumenda[.]zip\n\nWe\'ve observed that, in many cases, there are separate ZIP archives being hosted in different directories on the same domain at any given point in time. Inside of the ZIP archives, the malicious Office documents often follow a naming convention similar to the examples below:\n\nchart-1187900052.xls\ndiagram-127.doc\ndiagram_1017101088.xls\nspecification-1001661454.xls\n\nSince these campaigns began, we observed several variations in the way the documents function, so will describe two of the most common infection chains we observed in September. This threat is actively evolving, and during our research into SQUIRRELWAFFLE, we observed the distribution campaigns\' shift to almost exclusively using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for this purpose.\n\nMalicious Word documents\n\nAs previously described, the initial malicious Office document format used across many of the early email campaigns was a Microsoft Word document. In this case it was made to appear as if it was associated with DocuSign, a popular document sharing and signing platform that is often used for a variety of purposes related to official transactions.\n\nMalicious Excel spreadsheets\n\nMany of the campaigns were observed using malicious Excel spreadsheets rather than Word documents. \n\n These spreadsheets contain malicious Excel4 macros that are responsible for retrieving and executing the SQUIRRELWAFFLE payload. Below is an example of one of these macros that has been cleaned up to improve readability. \n\n Similar to what was observed with the Word document lures, these macros contain three hardcoded URLs that host the DLL associated with SQUIRRELWAFFLE. Once retrieved, the DLL is executed via ShellExecuteA and regsvr32.exe, thus infecting the system. The ZIP archives and associated maldocs are rotated across emails, resulting in large quantities of unique samples. However, the SQUIRRELWAFFLE distribution URLs appear to be fairly common across samples for a given email campaign. ', 'news/images/90.png', '', '<br/>'),

We\'ve given this new virus the', 'ESET researchers have discovered a unique and previously undescribed loader for Windows binaries that, unlike other such loaders, runs as a server and executes received modules in memory. We have named this new malware Wslink after one of its DLLs.\n\nWe have seen only a few hits in our telemetry in the past two years, with detections in Central Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The initial compromise vector is not known; most of the samples are packed with MPRESS and some parts of the code are virtualized. Unfortunately, so far we have been unable to obtain any of the modules it is supposed to receive. There are no code, functionality or operational similarities that suggest this is likely to be a tool from a known threat actor group.\n\nThe following sections contain analysis of the loader and our own implementation of its client, which was initially made to experiment with detection methods. This clientâ€™s source code might be of interest to beginners in malware analysis â€“ it shows how one can reuse and interact with existing functions of previously analyzed malware. The very analysis could also serve as an informative resource documenting this threat for blue teamers.\nTechnical analysis\n\nWslink runs as a service and listens on all network interfaces on the port specified in the ServicePort registry value of the serviceâ€™s Parameters key. The preceding component that registers the Wslink service is not known. Figure 1 depicts the code accepting incoming connections to that port.\n\nAccepting a connection is followed by an RSA handshake with a hardcoded 2048-bit public key to securely exchange both the key and IV to be used for 256-bit AES in CBC mode (see Figure 2). The encrypted module is subsequently received with a unique identifier â€“ signature â€“ and an additional key for its decryption.\n\nInterestingly, the most recently received encrypted module with its signature is stored globally, making it available to all clients. One can save traffic this way â€“ transmit only the key if the signature of the module to be loaded matches the previous one.\n\nAs seen in Figure 3, the decrypted module, which is a regular PE file, is loaded into memory using the MemoryModule library and its first export is finally executed. The functions for communication, socket, key and IV are passed in a parameter to the export, enabling the module to exchange messages over the already established connection.\n\nImplementation of the client\n\nOur own implementation of a Wslink client, described below, simply establishes a connection with a modified Wslink server and sends a module that is then decrypted and executed. As our client cannot know the private key matching the public key in any given Wslink server instance, we produced our own key pair and modified the server executable with the public key from that pair and used the private key in our Wslink client implementation.\n\nThis client enabled us to reproduce Wslinkâ€™s communication and search for unique patterns; it additionally confirmed our findings, because we could mimic its behavior.\n\nInitially some functions for sending/receiving messages are obtained from the original sample (see Figure 4) â€“ we can use them right away and do not have to reimplement them later.\n\nSubsequently, our client reads the private RSA key to be used from a file and a connection to the specified IP and port is established. It is expected that an instance of Wslink already listens on the supplied address and port. Naturally, its embedded public key must also be replaced with one whose private key is known.\n\nOur client and the Wslink server continue by performing the handshake that exchanges the key and IV to be used for AES encryption. This consists of three steps, as seen in Figure 5: sending a client hello, receiving the symmetric key with IV, and sending them back to verify successful decryption. From reversing the Wslink binary we learned that the only constraint of the hello message, apart from size 240 bytes, is that the second byte must be zero, so we just set it to all zeroes.', 'news/images/91.png', '', '<br/>'),

They generate a code for the user to enter when prompted, so that only the user possessing th', 'The average cost of a data breach, according to the latest research by IBM, now stands at USD 4.24 million, the highest reported. The leading cause? Compromised credentials, often caused by human error. Although these findings continue to show an upward trend in the wrong direction, the challenge itself is not new. What is new is the unprecedented and accelerated complexity of securing the workplace. CISOs/CIOs are dealing with legacy systems, cloud hosting, on-prem, remote workers, office based, traditional software, and SaaS.\n\nHow businesses adapted was laudable, but now that employees spread across locations, offices and homes â€“ with more than half threatening not to return to offices unless hybrid working is implemented â€“ the challenge morphs into securing a nonuniform perimeter.\n\nWe know passwords aren\'t sufficient. Knowledge-based access is usually fortified with other forms of multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as auth apps or FIDO tokens, and in highly sensitive cases, biometrics.\nWhy strong IAM is essential for hybrid working\n\nThe era of \'BYOD\' (Bring Your Own Device) has evolved into what Gartner calls Bring-Your-Own-Identity: employees are accessing data from a range of remote devices from a range of different locations.\n\nCybercriminals can intercept data in a variety of ways, from compromised credentials to phishing scams to man-in-the-middle attacks, which are made easier on public networks with no security controls, such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops or airports. If your employee access is only based on knowledge factors such as usernames and passwords, attackers could easily gain full access to sensitive data.\n\nHardware-based security tokens or dongles have gained popularity, particularly at the enterprise level. They generate a code for the user to enter when prompted, so that only the user possessing the token can gain access. But these separate, tiny hardware devices are not without their challenges.\nProblems with hardware authentication\n\nCost â€” Security tokens cost between $50-$100 on average for a single device. As a result, these devices tend to be reserved only for a few high-risk individuals â€“ while lower-profile employees are left vulnerable.\n\nLost devices â€” Hardware tokens can be lost, stolen, or forgotten, and employees often only notice right when they need access. Ordering new tokens is inconvenient and expensive.\n\nUX â€” Finding the device and entering the code takes user effort, and can\'t be easily used for rapid provisioning, personnel change, or work with outside contractors.\n\nAttack risk â€” Hardware tokens are also not completely effective against MITM attacks â€“ although they can\'t be directly remotely accessed, a bad actor can trick the user into entering the code on a fraudulent version of the website/login page.\n\nThere is an innovative, new technology that provides a strong possession factor for IAM without extra hardware devices â€“ and it\'s in everyone\'s hands already.\nMobile phone possession as an alternative to hardware tokens\n\nThe simpler, easier alternative to buying expensive tokens is to make use of something your employees already have: their mobile phone.\n\nUsing the advanced cryptographic security of the SIM card, mobile networks already authenticate customers securely and invisibly to allow calls and data. SIM-based authentication is tamper-resistant, real-time verification that works the same as chips in bank cards.\n\nWith no user action or codes to type, SIM-based authentication makes login simple for your employees, but keeps malicious actors out. By authenticating with the SIM card itself, rather than just the mobile number, it\'s also possible to check for recent SIM swap activity, stopping account takeover attacks.\n\nIt\'s much more cost-effective, deployable at scale, and universal, meaning every employee, not just a few, has the highest level of security. And unlike tiny and easily-lost hardware dongles, the mobile phone is an essential device that employees will already take with them everywhere.\n\nNow, APIs by tru.ID open up SIM-based network authentication for enterprises and businesses to implement frictionless, secure verification.\n\nAny additional concerns over user privacy are alleviated by the fact that tru.ID does not process personally identifiable information between the mobile network and its APIs. It\'s purely a URL-based lookup. ', 'news/images/94.png', '', '<br/>'),

Several of these flaws were rated as having a high risk of being exploited. \n(2', 'In a security advisory, Mozillaâ€™s announced that several security issues in its Firefox browser have been fixed. Several of these vulnerabilities were listed as having a high impact.\n\nPublicly disclosed computer security flaws are listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Its goal is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, databases, and services). Weâ€™ll discuss some of the CVEs fixed in this update below.\nXSLT in an iFrame\n\nListed as CVE-2021-38503, it fixes an issue where the iframe sandbox rules were not correctly applied to XSLT stylesheets, allowing an iframe to bypass restrictions such as executing scripts or navigating the top-level frame. Attackers could handle manipulated XSLT stylesheets and be able to execute scripts or break out onto the main frame.\n\nXSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents, or other formats such as HTML for web pages, plain text or XSL Formatting Objects, which may subsequently be converted to other formats, such as PDF, PostScript and PNG.\nUse-after-free in file picker dialog\n\nThe vulnerability listed under CVE-2021-38504 could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by a use-after-free in file picker dialog. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted website, a remote attacker could create an interaction with an HTML input elementâ€™s file picker dialog with webkitdirectory set. Use after free (UAF) is a vulnerability due to incorrect use of dynamic memory during a programâ€™s operation. If after freeing a memory location, a program does not clear the pointer to that memory, an attacker can use the error to manipulate the program.\nWindows 10 Cloud Clipboard\n\nThe vulnerability listed under CVE-2021-38505 only applies for users of Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud Clipboard enabled. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats. Firefox versions before 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement these formats. This could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a userâ€™s Microsoft account.\nUnsolicited full screen mode\n\nCVE-2021-38506 describes a vulnerability in which, through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered full screen mode without notification or warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI including phishing. This type of attack is particularly useful for Tech Support scammers because they can make the browser page look like a security warning or BSOD, and trick the user into calling a specific number.\nOpportunistic Encryption in HTTP2\n\nListed as CVE-2021-38507, the Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) doesnâ€™t opt-in to opportunistic encryption, a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage.\nQR code scan\n\nThe vulnerability listed under MOZ-2021-0003 does not have a CVE number assigned to it. The vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android. A Universal XSS vulnerability was present in Firefox for Android resulting from improper sanitization when processing a URL scanned from a QR code. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. QR codes are complicated barcodes that are popular among scammers. Itâ€™s advisable to use a QR scanner that checks or at least displays the URL before it follows the link.\nMemory safety bugs\n\nSeveral memory safety bugs were grouped under MOZ-2021-0007. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and it was presumed that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. These bugs were found by Mozilla developers and community members and have also been fixed in this update.\nHow to protect yourself\n\nAll of the issues listed above, and more, have been fixed in Firefox 94 and Firefox ESR 91.3. By default, Firefox updates automatically. You can always check for updates at any time, in which case an update is downloaded, but it is not installed until you restart Firefox.\n\n    Click the menu button, click Help and select About Firefox.\n    The About Mozilla Firefox window opens. Firefox will check for updates and, if an update is available, it will be downloaded automatically by default.\n\nStay safe, everyone!', 'news/images/94.png', '', '<br/>'),

UAF bugs allow for code substitution by using a dangling pointer in dynamic memory. In this case, it can be exploited for local escalation of privilege and, when paired with a remote code execution (RCE) bug, an exploit could allow attackers to gain administrative control over a targeted system.\n\nThe internet titan kept its lips zipped about the specifics of the attacks exploiting CVE-2021-1048, but the fact that theyâ€™re targeted raises the possibility of nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) groups carrying them out for espionage.\n\nThereâ€™s precedent for that: Earlier this year, Android devices were targeted in an espionage campaign that adapted the LodaRAT â€“ known for targeting Windows devices â€“ to also go after Android devices in a campaign that targeted Bangladesh.\nMost Severe Issues\n\nThe most severe of the updates address two critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities â€“ tracked as CVE-2021-0918 and CVE-2021-0930 â€“ in the System component. The flaws could enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process by sending a specially crafted transmission to targeted devices.\n\nâ€œThe severity assessment is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed,â€ according to the security update.\n\nThere are two more critical security flaws addressed in this monthâ€™s patches: CVE-2021-1924 and CVE-2021-1975, both of which affect Qualcomm components.\n\nYet another critical flaw can be found in Android TV remote service â€“ which allows Android phones or tablets to be used as a remote for an Android TV.

The actor is using a somewhat unusual infection chain technique where an intermediate unpacking module is hosted on a pastebin.com clone pastebin.pl. The intermediate unpacking stage is downloaded and decoded in memory before the final payload embedded within the original sample is decrypted and executed.\nHow did it work?\n\nInfection typically starts with a downloader module on a victim\'s server. We have observed downloaders in a standalone executable format and in a DLL format. The DLL downloader is run by the parent process w3wp.exe, which is the Exchange IIS worker process.\n\nThe initial downloader is a modified EfsPotato exploit to target proxyshell and PetitPotam vulnerabilities. The downloader runs an embedded obfuscated PowerShell command to connect and download a packed downloader module from the actor\'s infrastructure. The PowerShell command also executes an AMSI bypass to circumvent endpoint protection. The download server is hosted using the malicious domains fbi[.]fund and xxxs[.]info.\n\nThe initial packed loader module contains encrypted .NET resources as bitmap images. The decrypted content is the actual Babuk ransomware payload. To decrypt and unpack the payload, the loader connects to a URL on pastebin.pl containing the intermediate unpacker module. The unpacker module decrypts the embedded Babuk ransomware payload in memory and injects it into a newly created process AddInProcess32.\n\nThe Babuk ransomware module, running within the process AddInProcess32, enumerates the processes running on the victim\'s server and attempts to disable a number of processes related to backup products, such as Veeam backup service. It also deletes volume shadow service (VSS) snapshots from the server using vssadmin utility to make sure the encrypted files cannot be restored from their VSS copies. The ransomware module encrypts the files in the victim\'s server and appends a file extension .babyk to the encrypted files. The actor demands the victim pay $10,000 USD to obtain the decryption key to regain their files.\nSo what?\n\nBabuk is a ransomware that can be compiled for several hardware and software platforms. The compilation is configured through a ransomware builder. Windows and ARM for Linux are the most used compiled versions, but ESX and a 32-bit, old PE executable were observed over time. However, in this particular campaign, we found evidence of actors specifically targeting Windows.\n\nBabuk ransomware is nefarious by its nature and while it encrypts the victim\'s machine, it interrupts the system backup process and deletes the volume shadow copies. In early September 2021, Babuk source code and a binary builder were leaked, which may have encouraged new malicious actors to manipulate and deploy the malware. Recently, a Babuk decryptor has been released. Unfortunately, it is only effective on files encrypted with a number of leaked keys and cannot be used to decrypt files encrypted by the variant described in this blog post.  \n\nOrganizations should regularly update their servers and applications with the latest available patches from the vendors eliminating the vulnerabilities in their environment. Defenders should be constantly looking for suspicious events generated by detection systems for an abrupt service termination, abnormally high I/O rates for drives attached to their servers, the deletion of shadow copies or system configuration changes.\nInfection chain summary\n\nCisco Talos discovered a malicious campaign that used either a DLL or .NET executable. One of the two types of files starts the infection chain on the targeted system. The initial .NET executable module runs as a child process of w3wp.exe and invokes the command shell to run an obfuscated PowerShell command.\n\nThe PowerShell command invokes a web request and downloads the payload loader module using certutil.exe from a URL hosted on the domains fbi[.]fund and xxxs[.]info, or the IP address 185[.]219[.]52[.]229.\n\nThe payload loader downloads an intermediate unpacking stage from the PasteBin clone site pastebin.pl. The unpacker concatenates the bitmap images embedded in the resource section of the trojan and decrypts the payload into the memory. The payload is injected into the process AddInProcess32 and is used to encrypt files on the victim\'s server and all mounted drives. \n\nStage 1: Downloaders\n\nWe\'ve observed the initial executable or DLL targeting servers that use Intel and AMD architecture. Usually, if an executable has w3wp (the IIS worker process in Exchange) as the parent process, this means the attacker has exploited a ProxyShell vulnerability. The observed infected systems also had the China Chopper web shell installed. We believe China Chopper eventually ran the initial download command.\n\nOur telemetry also indicates that the actor\'s infrastructure was active in attempting to exploit a number of vulnerabilities in other products most commonly triggering the following Snort rules:\n\n    Microsoft Exchange autodiscover server side request forgery attempt (57907)\n    Atlassian Confluence OGNL injection remote code execution attempt (58094)\n    Apache Struts remote code execution attempt (39190, 39191)\n    WordPress wp-config.php access via directory traversal attempt (41420)\n    SolarWinds Orion authentication bypass attempt (56916)\n    Oracle WebLogic Server remote command execution attempt (50020)\n    Liferay arbitrary Java object deserialization attempt (56800)\n\n\nDLL\n\nWe observed that the parent process w3wp.exe an IIS worker process that runs the .NET applications launches the downloader DLL.. The DLL is a mixed mode assembly, whose functionality is included in the native entry point of the library DllMainCRTStartup. The DllMainCRTStartup function calls the command shell to run an encoded PowerShell command to download the next stage\'s loader from hxxp://fbi[.]fund/dark.exe, which is the main packed module containing the final payload. \n\nStage 2: Main module loader\n\nThe second stage, the main ransomware loader contains the final payload. It\'s a 32-bin .NET executable masquerading as a legitimate stock management system (SMS) application not to be confused with the SMS messaging protocol. The module is packed with ConfuserEx, a free, open-source protector for .NET applications. This stage is downloaded by a process launched by the Exchange IIS worker process.\n\nThe application contains the final payload in an encrypted format, split between the .NET resources.\n\nIt attempts to connect to the URL https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/a57be2ca and download the intermediate module required for unpacking the final payload. \n\nRansom note\nThe payload module creates a file called How To Restore your Files.txt, which contains a notification to the victim that their network is compromised and their files are encrypted using AES-256-CTR with the ChaCha8 cipher.\nThe actor demands the victim to pay equivalent of 10000 USD paid in Monero (XMR) to the wallet address\n46zdZVRjm9XJhdjpipwtYDY51NKbD74bfEffxmbqPjwH6efTYrtvbU5Et4AKCre9MeiqtiR51Lvg2X8dXv1tP7nxLaEHKKQ\nThe actor has also disclosed their email IDs for the victims to contact them for the further instructions and the decryption key after making the payment.\n\nIOCs\nDomains\n\nfbi[.]fund\nxxxs[.]info\n\nIP addresses\n\n185[.]219[.]52[.]229\n168[.]119[.]93[.]163\n54[.]221[.]65[.]242\n\nURLs\n\nhxxp://fbi.fund/tortillas/tortilla.exe\nhxxp://fbi[.]fund/dark.exe\nhxxp://fbi[.]fund/tortillas/tore.exe\nhxxp://185[.]219[.]52[.]229/tortillas/tortilla.exe\nhxxp://185[.]219[.]52[.]229/tortillas/tore.exe\nhxxp://185[.]219[.]52[.]229/tortilla.exe\nhxxp://185[.]219[.]52[.]229:8080/vefEPjwOdNF9qNw.hta\nhxxps://pastebin[.]pl/view/raw/a57be2ca', 'news/images/100.png', '', '<br/>'),

The vulnerability, which affects all versions starting from 11.9, has since been addressed by GitLab on April 14, 2021 in versions 13.8.8, 13.9.6, and 13.10.3.\n\nIn one of the real-world attacks detailed by HN Security last month, two user accounts with admin privileges were registered on a publicly-accessible GitLab server belonging to an unnamed customer by exploiting the aforementioned flaw to upload a malicious payload \"image,\" leading to remote execution of commands that granted the rogue accounts elevated permissions.\n\nAttacks exploiting the vulnerability are said to have begun as early as June this year, coinciding with the public availability of proof-of-concept (PoC) code required to breach the servers.\n\nAlthough the flaw was initially deemed to be a case of authenticated RCE and assigned a CVSS score of 9.9, the severity rating was revised to 10.0 on September 21, 2021 owing to the fact that it can be triggered by unauthenticated threat actors as well.\n\n\"Despite the tiny move in CVSS score, a change from authenticated to unauthenticated has big implications for defenders,\" cybersecurity firm Rapid7 said in an alert published Monday.\n\nTelemetry data gathered by the Boston-based company show that of the 60,000 internet-facing GitLab installations, only 21% of the instances are fully patched against the issue, with another 50% still vulnerable to RCE attacks regardless of the fact that the patches have been up for grabs for more than six months.\n\nIn the light of the unauthenticated nature of this vulnerability, exploitation activity is expected to increase, making it critical that GitLab users update to the latest version as soon as possible. \"In addition, ideally, GitLab should not be an internet facing service,\" the researchers said. \"If you need to access your GitLab from the internet, consider placing it behind a VPN.\"\n\nAdditional technical analysis related to the vulnerability can be accessed here.\n\nUpdate: Threat actors are now actively exploiting the security flaw to co-opt unpatched GitLab servers into a botnet and launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, with some in excess of 1 terabits per second (Tbps), according to Google security reliability engineer Damian Menscher.', 'news/images/101.png', '', '<br/>'),

(89, 'Apple macOS Vulnerability Allows Kernel-Level Compromise', '2021-11-02', 'Threatpost', '(1)â€˜Shrootlessâ€™ allows bypass of System Integrity Protection IT security measures to install a malicious rootkit that goes undetected and performs arbitrary device operations.\n(2)Researchers disco', '\n\nâ€˜Shrootlessâ€™ allows bypass of System Integrity Protection IT security measures to install a malicious rootkit that goes undetected and performs arbitrary device operations.\n\nApple has patched a vulnerability in macOS can allow attackers to bypass a key OS protection and install a malicious rootkit to perform arbitrary operations on a device, researchers from Microsoft have discovered.\n\nThe problemâ€”dubbed â€œShrootlessâ€â€“is associated with a security technology called System Integrity Protection (SIP) found in macOS. Jonathan Bar Or from the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team explained in a blog post that SIP restricts a user at the root level of the OS from performing operations that may compromise system integrity.\n\nResearchers were assessing processes entitled to bypass SIP protections when they discovered the vulnerability, which is being tracked as CVE-2021-30892, Or wrote.\n\nâ€œWe found that the vulnerability lies in how Apple-signed packages with post-install scripts are installed,â€ he explained in the post. â€œA malicious actor could create a specially crafted file that would hijack the installation process. After bypassing SIPâ€™s restrictions, the attacker could then install a malicious kernel driver (rootkit), overwrite system files, or install persistent, undetectable malware, among others.â€\n\nMicrosoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR) shared the researchersâ€™ findings to Apple through its Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), and the company responded promptly, Or said. Apple included a fix for the flaw in a raft of security updates it released on Oct. 26\n\nMicrosoftâ€™s interest in a MacOS flaw demonstrates researchersâ€™ interest in security for  enterprise networks that use hybrid environments, which increase the attack surface for threat actors to compromise myriad devices regardless of OS, Or noted.\n\nâ€œThis OS-level vulnerability and others that will inevitably be uncovered add to the growing number of possible attack vectors for attackers to exploit,â€ he wrote. â€œAs networks become increasingly heterogeneous, the number of threats that attempt to compromise non-Windows devices also increases.â€\nHow SIP Works\n\nOr explained how SIP works to give context for the flaw. Apple first introduced the process, also known as â€œrootless,â€ in macOS Yosemite. The process â€œessentially locks down the system from root by leveraging the Apple sandbox to protect the entire platform,â€ Or explained.\n\nTwo NVRAM variables control the system: csr-active-config, a bitmask of enabled protections; and csr-data, which stores netboot configuration.\n\nâ€œThese variables cannot be legitimately modified in non-recovery mode,â€ Or wrote. â€œTherefore, the only legitimate way to disable SIP is by booting into recovery mode and turning SIP off. Turning SIP on or off is done using the built-in csrutil tool, which can also display the SIP status.â€\n\nSIP has a number of protections that it uses to secure the macOS kernel and other root processes. Attackers can bypass SIP, however, using a number of attack scenarios, Or wrote.\n\nFor instance, they could load untrusted kernel extensions could compromise the kernel and allow the said extensions to perform operations without any checks, or bypass filesystem checks that allow a kernel extension to enforce SIP to itself completely. Attackers also could freely modify the NVRAM to control SIP itself, researchers said.\nBreakdown of Shrootless\n\nResearchers discovered Shrootless when, in their analysis, they came across the daemon system_installd, which has the powerful com.apple.rootless.install.heritable entitlement. With this entitlement, any child process of system_installd would be able to bypass SIP filesystem restrictions altogether, Or wrote.\n\nUpon examining all the child processes of system_installd, researchers discovered a few cases that could allow attackers to abuse its functionality and bypass SIP, he explained.\n\nâ€œFor instance, when installing an Apple-signed package (.PKG file), the said package invokes system_installd, which then takes charge of installing the former,â€ Or wrote. â€œIf the package contains any post-install scripts, system_installd runs them by invoking a default shell, which is zsh on macOS. Interestingly, when zsh starts, it looks for the file /etc/zshenv, and â€” if found â€” runs commands from that file automatically, even in non-interactive mode.â€\n\nTherefore, an attacker can perform arbitrary operations on the device by creating a malicious /etc/zshenv file and then waiting for system_installd to invoke zsh, he explained.\n\nResearchers created a fully functional proof-of-concept (PoC) Shrootless exploit that could override the kernel extension exclusion list using three steps. The PoC downloads an Apple-signed package (using wget) that is known to have a post-install script; then plants a malicious /etc/zshenv that checks for its parent process; and finally, if itâ€™s system_installd, writes to restricted locations; and invokes the installer utility to install the package.\n\nThe Microsoft team also found that zshenv could be used as a general attack technique as a persistence mechanism or to elevate privileges besides being used for a SIP bypass, Or wrote.', 'news/images/103.png', '', '<br/>'),

We\'ll also look at your alternatives for replacing CentOS 8.\n\nFinally, we\'ll do a review of your other option: choosing extended support. Extended lifecycle support (ELS) can reduce the pressure to decide on alternative distribution and it may well be the most practical route for many CentOS 8 users.\nOfficial support is critical\n\nThe difficulties around CentOS 8 involve the sudden withdrawal of official support. Official support window timeframes matter because it gives Linux users certainty that they will continue to receive bug fixes as well as patches for CVEs and security vulnerabilities that emerge.\n\nA fixed end date for support gives users the ability to plan â€“ either upgrading ahead of the end date, or migrating workloads to an alternative if upgrading isn\'t a viable option.\n\nWhile this is an important consideration for people who run a single CentOS instance and for small teams, official support windows become critical for those who depend on CentOS to support large-scale workloads involving big server fleets.\n\nA single user or small team can quickly shift distributions, but planning for any changes that involve thousands of machines is a whole different story.\nA free Linux distribution â€“ with rock-solid official support\n\nCentOS had its origins in 2002. The project, a 1:1 fork of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, went through various changes over time. In 2014, Red Hat announced that it would officially sponsor the CentOS project â€“ but in doing so, Red Hat took full control of CentOS, including intellectual assets, and the governing board.\n\nRed Hat invested a lot of effort into the CentOS project, and CentOS enjoyed a fixed release schedule with equally fixed, reliable support windows. As of late, the CentOS project was quoting 10-year maintenance support windows which was fantastic news for enterprise users who could adopt new releases at a pace that suited them, with long time frames for planning and testing.\n\nAnd, of course, CentOS is entirely free â€“ saving companies thousands in licensing fees. For example, when CentOS 7 was released in 2014, users were told that they will continue to enjoy support through June 2024. With CentOS 8 coming out in September 2019, it gave enterprise users a long time frame to test and switch to CentOS 8.\n\nSome CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 users moved quickly and adopted CentOS 8, but these users were in for a surprise.\nWhat changed with CentOS 8?\n\nWhen CentOS 8 was released, the CentOS project (and by that we really mean Red Hat) promised that it would continue to support CentOS 8 for about ten years officially â€“ just like it did for CentOS 7. The original end of life date for CentOS 8 was May 31, 2029.\n\nThat\'s an excellent support window for a free-to-use, enterprise-grade Linux OS which is also 1:1 binary compatible with RHEL. It meant that enterprise users could essentially avoid paying RHEL license fees, while still working with a trusted distribution.\n\nUnfortunately, the good news ended rather suddenly in December 2020 when Red Hat unexpectedly announced that it will no longer release CentOS as a stable release at regular intervals, instead focusing on CentOS Stream â€“ a rolling release model, which is delivered differently and whose suitability for enterprise application is still unknown.\n\nProducts come and go and a change of direction can be somewhat understandable, but the real sting in the announcement was that official support for CentOS 8 will be curtailed by almost eight years â€“ with end-of-life now on Dec 31, 2021 rather than the originally promised May 31, 2029.\n\nAfter that date, the CentOS Project will no longer publish updates for CentOS 8. Bugs won\'t be fixed but, more critically, new vulnerabilities won\'t receive patches. In other words, if a major flaw in â€“ for example â€“ the Linux kernel emerges, you simply won\'t get an automatic patch for CentOS 8.\n\nThat is in contrast to what organizations were originally promised for CentOS 8 â€“ a matching patch within 72 hours of the patch being released for RHEL 8, right through the middle of 2029. It creates an enormous headache for tech teams that must now act fast to replace CentOS 8.\nWhy doing nothing isn\'t an option\n\nYou might think that your workloads are running just fine, and that there\'s no need to update your CentOS 8 instances to apply bug fixes. Or, that you can simply apply internally coded patches or other remediation measures should a threat arise.\n\nIn reality, the risks of running an unsupported OS are significant. You can use this calculator to estimate the costs and get a rough figure for your particular infrastructure. We\'ve published an in-depth article here, but let\'s do a quick recap of the potential problems you face when your OS is no longer enjoying official maintenance support.\n\n    Breaking compatibility and reliability. An OS is surrounded by other software components and if you fail to update your OS with bug fixes, you may find that updates to other components break compatibility -- you end up with updated software and services, but an OS that was never updated with the feature change.\n\n    Security risks. This is the big one: if you don\'t receive regular updates to your OS you will rapidly accumulate a growing number of security holes in your workload as more and more vulnerabilities get published in public â€“ but never fixed on your systems. All it takes is one entry point for a hacker to gain entry and potential catastrophe to occur.\n\n    Compliance problems. Compliance requirements such as PCI require that systems are patched against vulnerabilities within a specific time frame. When your OS is unsupported you are at risk of breaching compliance requirements which can lead to stiff penalties, the loss of customers â€“ or indeed losing the right to do business altogether.\n\nThat\'s just a brief insight into the potential problems of running CentOS 8 past the end of this year. It\'s an enormous risk which is no wonder that companies are rushing to try and come up with alternatives.\nThe problem with CentOS stream\n\nRed Hat isn\'t discontinuing the CentOS Project altogether â€“ CentOS will continue to exist in the form of CentOS Stream, which will always be one step ahead of the latest RHEL release. While Red Hat is suggesting that CentOS Stream is a drop-in replacement, that\'s only true for a limited number of use cases.\n\nMany Linux OS use cases â€“ particularly in the enterprise environment â€“ depend on stable releases: fixed functionality that can be tested, and the assurance that nothing of substance will change until the next release. Indeed, Red Hat\'s own CTO has said that CentOS Stream is not a replacement for CentOS 8.\n\nThe move to the new CentOS Stream may affect the release stability. It will no longer have exactly the same package versions as RHEL - in fact, packages will land in CentOS Stream before making it into a fixed RHEL release. Binary compatibility may suffer, and some organizations\' workloads cannot easily accommodate this.\n\nCentOS Stream would be a perfectly acceptable replacement for some users â€“ some scientific teams, for example. However, most large-scale user cases involving more than a handful of machines will need to examine alternative operating systems â€“ or alternative support options. And there\'s not much time left given CentOS 8 is end-of-life in just a few months.\nHow about downgrading to CentOS 7?\n\nIn one of the few cases where leaving things to the last minute has paid off, CentOS 7 users are continuing to enjoy the support window the Red Hat originally committed to â€“ with CentOS 7 maintenance support set to last until June 30, 2024. That\'s a rather useful two and a half years beyond CentOS 8 support.\n\nSo how about going back to CentOS 7 as a temporary measure? There is, unfortunately, no supported downgrade path back to CentOS 7. Yes, some unsupported solutions are out there, but you\'re at risk of ending up with a system that is in some type of Frankenstein state â€“ containing elements of both releases. You\'re almost certain to experience problems further down the line.\nTaking a look at binary compatible alternatives\n\nWe will divide your alternatives to CentOS 8 into two categories: distributions that are binary compatible with CentOS 8 (and by consequence RHEL 8), and distributions that are relatively close in purpose â€“ but that will require more work to adopt. We\'re taking this approach because so many organizations relied on the 1:1 binary compatibility between CentOS 8 and RHEL.\n\nChoosing a distribution that is binary compatible with CentOS 8 implies that your team has relatively minimal work in terms of switching distributions. In fact, you may be able to switch from CentOS 8 to an alternative distribution just by running a script â€“ but, tech teams will still need to double-check that nothing is broken in the transition. These are your binary compatible options:\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)\n\nWe mention RHEL first because, by definition, RHEL 8 is 1:1 binary compatible with CentOS 8. Yes, ordinarily, there is a licensing fee associated with RHEL, but due to the backlash against Red Hat\'s decisions around CentOS, Red Hat decided to extend the free version of RHEL.\n\nRed Hat has expanded the free of charge Individual Developer subscription program to now include workloads that involve up to 16 systems. So, if your workloads involve 16 or fewer CentOS instances and if you\'re certain you won\'t require a larger number of machines, RHEL could be a good choice involving minimal disruption.\n\nMost enterprise CentOS deployments have far more than 16 active instances and these workloads will incur a licensing fee.\nOracle Linux\n\nEnterprise users might naturally look towards another free enterprise alternative â€“ Oracle\'s 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL, called Oracle Linux. Oracle claims that Oracle Linux is fully compatible with CentOS, and anyone who already uses Oracle products will find the tight integration with Oracle\'s other products helpful.\n\nWhile Oracle Linux has a proven track record in the enterprise space, there are some issues around the direction of other products under the Oracle aegis, like Java, that have come up during the years, and, arguably, instilled some reluctance when going with the brand.\nAlmaLinux\n\nAlmaLinux OS is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL â€“ and therefore binary compatible with CentOS. AlmaLinux is under the purview of a 501(c)(6) non-profit foundation with a Board of Directors composed of people from around the industry and the community, and community adoption has grown steadily over the months. It already supports most hardware platforms supported by CentOS, is present on the largest cloud provider\'s offers and has matched all the announced releases dates along the way.\n\nThere has been some competition between AlmaLinux OS and Rocky Linux, which was to be expected since both target the same audience.\n\nThat said, AlmaLinux was faster out of the gate with a production first release than Rocky Linux and the community reception has been positive. AlmaLinux has also recently become available as an OS install on Microsoft\'s Azure and offer a set of RHEL UBI equivalent containers as well.\nRocky Linux\n\nThe early CentOS project merged with a project called CAOS Linux, founded by Gregory Kurtzer in 2002.. After limited involvement, Kurtzer moved on from CentOS to other projects and was needless to say unhappy about Red Hat\'s announcement and the changing future of CentOS, so rapidly acted to create a new, binary compatible fork of RHEL â€“ and called it Rocky Linux.\n\nRocky Linux is binary compatible with CentOS so it is easy to switch to. The open source project is, however, currently under Kurtzer\'s full ownership and control although he has made statements about opening that up to others. So, again, there can be concerns that there might be a change of course with Rocky Linux â€“ much the same as Red Hat did with CentOS.\n\nOther binary compatible alternatives\n\nCentOS users can also look at ClearOS and Springdale Linux, but in both cases the supporting communities are relatively small. Springdale Linux is backed by serious institutions though â€“ with both the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University backing it. While ClearOS has links with HP Enterprise, ClearOS 8 has not yet been released which casts a shadow over the project.\n\nScientific Linux isn\'t an option as the backers, Fermilab, had said they won\'t release another version beyond release 7 â€“ so there\'s no alternative for CentOS 8 here. For some users, Amazon Linux could be worth investigating â€“ it\'s backed by the tech giant and is a CentOS-based clone of RHEL, but you can only run it on Amazon Web Services.\nNon binary-compatible distributions to consider\n\nYou may well decide that RHEL and its related distributions do not offer any unique features â€“ aside from the original advantage that CentOS is a free RHEL clone. Depending on your workload, migration may be relatively effortless â€“ but you\'d nonetheless need to prepare and test to a far greater degree compared to migrating to binary compatible distribution.\n\nOne of the most obvious alternatives is also one of the most established â€“ Canonical\'s Ubuntu. It is, of course, derived from Debian â€“ which means it is some distance away from RHEL and therefore shifting from CentOS to Ubuntu will be a fairly big operation.\n\nIt all depends on how much of your code is specific to CentOS and whether you rely on vendors for software or write your own code internally. Either way, Ubuntu has the necessary track record and it may well be a sensible option.\n\nThere are plenty of other, trusted distributions you could think about. OpenSUSE, for example, is offered free for use by SUSE Linux and has a solid reputation, it\'s been around for more than 15 years. You could also opt for Debian. However, switching to a new Linux distribution can be more complicated than it sounds. Some points you need to watch out for include:\n\n    Monitoring and management systems need to change because the OS that supports your workload has changed significantly.\n    Development efforts required â€“ both to adjust everyday scripts, and to change the code in the applications that run on your operating system.\n    Coping with different package management mechanisms â€“ RPM on CentOS, RHEL and related distributions, PKG on Debian and Ubuntu.\n    Time consumed and risk associated with the migration process, which comes down to a complete system re-install given the difference between, say, RHEL-based and Debian-based distributions.\n\nIn other words, choosing a distribution that\'s not in the RHEL family may involve significantly more work than you intended and it\'s not a decision to be made lightly.\nConsider extended support to buy time\n\nAt the start of this article we promised you an alternative route that mitigates the urgency created by Red Hat\'s decision. It\'s a simple concept: relying on a third-party to extend maintenance support for CentOS 8.\n\nA good extended support service will cover you for essential bug fixes and any emerging vulnerabilities. In other words, if a new threat emerges that affects CentOS 8 your extended support provider will roll out a patch to counter the threat.\n\nThat means that you remain secure â€“ given that new threats are always patched â€“ and compliant, given that your workloads do not accumulate vulnerabilities over time. By consequence, you can carry on running CentOS 8, buying yourself more time to switch to a new distribution.\n\nTuxCare\'s Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) for CentOS 8 essentially continues the RHEL support commitment. In fact, ELS from TuxCare improves on what RHEL promised for CentOS â€“ with patches rolled out within two working days instead of three. TuxCare also has the know-how and the reputation to deliver â€“ with an established product that\'s part of the CloudLinux product portfolio.\n\nTuxCare has committed to providing extended maintenance support for CentOS 8 through 2025 â€“ giving you several more years to make a decision about your CentOS 8 workloads, instead of just four months. It significantly reduces the pressure on your team.\nAct now and secure your CentOS 8 workload\n\nCentOS 8 maintenance support is ending, and it ends soon. Organizations that still rely on CentOS 8 do not have a huge amount of time to make a decision about an alternative distribution.\n\nWe\'ve outlined a couple of distributions that you can essentially use as drop-in replacements, but given that two of these are brand new it is understandable that you may want to see how these distributions pan out before you commit.\n\nIf that\'s the case, consider signing up for extended support to buy yourself some more time to decide. However, you must make a decision of some sort. Not acting is not an option â€“ the risks are simply too great.', 'news/images/106.png', '', '<br/>'),

An attacker can exploit the argument to send operating system commands to the Apache server.\n\nâ€œThis vulnerability was not exploitable when reached through the REST API since the username that holds the payload cannot be controlled by an attacker,â€ Alvaro Munoz, researcher at GitHub Security Labs, told The Daily Swig.\n\nâ€œHowever, I found out that I could directly call the Thrift service and provide any username.â€\n\nWhen called directly through the Nimbus Thrift port, the function does not require any special privileges, which leads to a pre-auth RCE. Munoz posted a proof-of-concept that exploits the bug to execute the â€˜touchâ€™ command on the server operating system.\n\nâ€œThe Apache Storm security guide recommends enabling a firewall and to restrict network access to these services, but unfortunately, there are many publicly exposed servers not following these recommendations,â€ Munoz said.\n\nUnsafe deserialization on supervisor server\n\nThe second bug was found in Stormâ€™s supervisor service, which runs on top of a Netty server. In his research, Munoz discovered that the serverâ€™s inbound pipeline (the different handlers that process the incoming network packets) uses an object parser that is prone to unsafe deserialization. An attacker can exploit the bug to send a malicious object and run it on the server.\n\nMunoz became familiar with the Netty framework during a recent code review of Apache Dubbo, where he modeled the library with CodeQL, GitHubâ€™s semantic code analysis engine, and identified possible sources of untrusted data.\n\nâ€œMy past experience reviewing Apache Dubbo granted me familiarity with the Netty framework and in particular with the Netty architecture and inbound pipelines,â€ Munoz said.\n\nA proof-of-concept shows the bug being exploited to load a gadget payload and run a DNS resolution command on the server. Like the code injection vulnerability, the deserialization bug also leads to pre-auth RCE.\n\nâ€œWhen I first reviewed the CodeQL result, I wasnâ€™t sure about the criticality of the issue since the Storm workers can be configured to require authentication,â€ Munoz said. â€œHowever, after looking at the Netty inbound pipeline, I realized that the authentication was applied after triggering the deserialization. Therefore, an attacker would be able to trigger it with no valid credentials.â€\n\nKey takeaways\n\nâ€œThese vulnerabilities can affect default installations of Apache Storm. It is recommended to update as per the announcements,â€ Derek Dagit, member of the Apache Storm Project Management Committee (PMC), told The Daily Swig.\n\nRegarding the code injection bug, Dagit said that the key takeaway is to treat any code that invokes an interpreter with scrutiny.\n\nâ€œThe serialization vulnerability is harder to exploit, but its takeaway is simpler: In general, Java native serialization without registered types isnâ€™t safe, neither as a default nor as a fallback,â€ he added.\n\nMunoz recommended that web developers should apply validations as close as possible to the point where data is going to be consumed.\n\nThe Apache Storm vulnerabilities are also a reminder that authentication should be applied as early as possible in the data processing chain to reduce the chances of unauthenticated users being able to trigger potential vulnerabilities in the code, he said.\n\nâ€œGenerally, enabling static analysis in your build pipeline can help you prevent critical bugs like these ones. If you maintain an open-source project, I encourage you to enable CodeQL-powered code scanning for free,â€ Munoz added.', 'news/images/109.png', '', '<br/>'),

Counterintuitively, this quarter saw growth in DDoS attacks even while cryptocurrency prices are still high.\n\nâ€œNow, judging by the growing DDoS market against the backdrop of consistently high cryptocurrency prices, attackers have started to allocate their resources differently,â€ the report said. â€œAnd this is quite logical: DDoS services are in demand, and the prolonged supply shortage has likely led to an increase in prices in this market, making it profitable for botnet operators to resume attacks. As such, the DDoS market seems to be returning to the growth rate we saw in late 2019.â€\n\nWith predictions indicating more DDoS attacks on the way, itâ€™s up to organizations to mount a defense and protecting internet of things (IoT) devices connected to public networks from being hijacked and turned into botnets, Ben Pick, a consultant and nVisum told Threatpost.\n\nâ€œOrganizations can protect themselves by applying intermediate tooling at network boundaries, Pick said. â€œMost cloud services include security tools to mitigate or outright prevent DDoS attacks. Utilizing a specific tool is a better protection apparatus than spinning up resources to accommodate the additional network bandwidth, as that can cause massive impacts to the overall infrastructure costs.â€', 'news/images/110.png', '', '<br/>'),

It allows for unauthenticated RCE on multiple versions of PAN-OS 8.1 prior to 8.1.17, on both physical and virtual firewalls.\n\n111021 14:04 UPDATE: The PAN updates cover versions 9.0 and 9.1, but based on Randoriâ€™s research, those versions arenâ€™t vulnerable to this particular CVE. A spokesperson told Threatpost that any updates to non-8.1 versions are likely unrelated to CVE 2021-3064.\n\n111021 17:28 UPDATE: Palo Alto has updated its advisory to clarify that this bug doesnâ€™t affect  versions besides PAN-OS 8.1 prior to 8.1.17.\n\nRandori researchers said in a Wednesday post that if an attacker successfully exploits the weakness, they can gain a shell on the targeted system, access sensitive configuration data, extract credentials and more.\n\nAfter that, attackers can dance across a targeted organization, they said: â€œOnce an attacker has control over the firewall, they will have visibility into the internal network and can proceed to move laterally.â€\n\nGoing by a Shodan search of internet-exposed devices, Randori initially believed that there are â€œmore than 70,000 vulnerable instances exposed on internet-facing assets.â€\n\n111021 17:30 UPDATE: Palo Alto Network informed Randori that the number of affected devices is closer to 10,000.\n\nThe Randori Attack Team found the zero day a year ago, developed a working exploit and used it against Randori customers (with authorization) over the past year. Below is the teamâ€™s video of the exploit:\n\nDonâ€™t Panic, But Do Patch\n\nRandori has coordinated disclosure with PAN. On Wednesday, PAN published an advisory and an update to patch CVE-2021-3064.\n\nRandoriâ€™s also planning to release more technical details on Wednesday, â€œonce the patch has had enough time to soak,â€ and will issue updates at @RandoriAttack on Twitter, according to its writeup.\n\nWhile Randori is setting aside 30 days before releasing yet more detailed technical information that it usually provides in its attack notes â€“ a grace period for customers to patch or upgrade â€“ it did give some higher-level details.\nVulnerability Chain Details\n\nRandori said that CVE-2021-3064 is a buffer overflow that occurs while parsing user-supplied input into a fixed-length location on the stack. To get to the problematic code, attackers would have to use an HTTP smuggling technique, researchers explained. Otherwise, itâ€™s not reachable externally.\n\nHTTP request smuggling is a technique for interfering with the way a web site processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from one or more users.\n\nThese kinds of vulnerabilities are often critical, as they allow an attacker to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and directly compromise other application users. A recent example was a bug that cropped up in February in Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications thatâ€™s used in IBM Planning Analytics.\n\nExploitation of the buffer overflow done in conjunction with HTTP smuggling together yields RCE under the privileges of the affected component on the firewall device, according to Randoriâ€™s analysis. The HTTP smuggling wasnâ€™t given a CVE identifier, as Palo Alto Networks doesnâ€™t consider it a security boundary, they explained.\n\nTo exploit the bug, an attacker needs network access to the device on the GlobalProtect service port (default port 443).\n\nâ€œAs the affected product is a VPN portal, this port is often accessible over the Internet,â€ researchers pointed out.\n\nVirtual firewalls are particularly vulnerable, given that they lack Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), the researchers said. â€œOn devices with ASLR enabled (which appears to be the case in most hardware devices), exploitation is difficult but possible. On virtualized devices (VM-series firewalls), exploitation is significantly easier due to lack of ASLR and Randori expects public exploits will surface.â€ When it comes to certain hard device versions with MIPS-based management plane CPUs, Randori researchers havenâ€™t exploited the buffer overflow to achieve controlled code execution, they said, â€œdue to their big endian architecture.â€ But they noted that â€œthe overflow is reachable on these devices and can be exploited to limit availability of services.â€\n\nThey referred to PANâ€™s VM-Series of virtualized firewalls, deployed in public and private cloud computing environments and powered by VMware, Cisco, Citrix, KVM, OpenStack, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google as perimeter gateways, IPSec VPN termination points and segmentation gateways. PAN describes the firewalls as being designed to prevent threats from moving from workload to workload.\n\nRandori said that the bug affects firewalls running the 8.1 series of PAN-OS with GlobalProtect enabled (specifically, as noted above, versions < 8.1.17). The companyâ€™s red-team researchers have proved exploitation of the vulnerability chain and attained RCE on both physical and virtual firewall products.\n\nThereâ€™s no public exploit code available â€“ yet â€“ and there are both PANâ€™s patch and threat prevention signatures available to block exploitation, Randori said.\nExploit Code Sure to Follow\n\nRandori noted that public exploit code will likely surface, given what tasty targets VPN devices are for malicious actors.\n\nRandori CTO David â€œmooseâ€ Wolpoff has written for Threatpost, explaining why he loves breaking into security appliances and VPNs: After all, they present one convenient lock for attackers to pick, and then presto, they can invade an enterprise.\n\nThe Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack is a case in point, Wolpoff recently wrote: As Colonialâ€™s CEO told a Senate committee in June (PDF), attackers were able to compromise the company through a legacy VPN account.\n\nâ€œThe account lacked multi-factor authentication (MFA) and wasnâ€™t in active use within the business,â€ Wolpoff noted. Itâ€™s â€œa scenario unlikely to be unique to the fuel pipeline,â€ he added.\nHow Palo Alto Customers Can Mitigate the Threat\n\nPatching as soon as possible is of course the top recommendation, but Randori offered these mitigation options if thatâ€™s not doable:\n\n    Enable signatures for Unique Threat IDs 91820 and 91855 on traffic destined for GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces to block attacks against this vulnerability.\n    If you donâ€™t use the GlobalProtect VPN portion of the Palo Alto firewall, disable it.\n    For any internet-facing application:\n        Disable or remove any unused features\n        Restrict origin IPs allowed to connect to services\n        Apply layered controls (such as WAF, firewall, access controls, segmentation)\n        Monitor logs and alerts from the device\n\nThe â€˜Bigger Storyâ€™: Ethically Using a Zero Day\n\nRandori pointed out that Wolpoff has blogged about why zero-days are essential to security, and the Palo Alto Networks zero day is a prime example.\n\nâ€œAs the threat from zero-days grows, more and more organizations are asking for realistic ways to prepare for and train against unknown threats, which translates to a need for ethical use of zero-days,â€ the researchers said in their writeup. â€œWhen a defender is unable to patch a flaw, they must rely on other controls. Real exploits let them validate those controls, and not simply in a contrived manner. Real exploits let customers scrimmage against the same class of threats they are already facing.â€', 'news/images/113.png', '', '<br/>'),
(100, 'Zoho Password Manager Flaw Torched by Godzilla Webshell', '2021-11-08', 'Threatpost', '(1)A new campaign is prying apart a known security vulnerability in the Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus password manager, researchers warned over the weekend.\n(2)The threat actors have managed to', '\n\nResearchers have spotted a second, worldwide campaign exploiting the ManagedEngine SelfServiceAD Plus zero-day: one thatâ€™s breached defense, energy and healthcare organizations.\n\nA new campaign is prying apart a known security vulnerability in the Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus password manager, researchers warned over the weekend. The threat actors have managed to exploit the Zoho weakness in at least nine global entities across critical sectors so far (technology, defense, healthcare, energy and education), deploying the Godzilla webshell and exfiltrating data.\n\nOn Sunday, Palo Alto Networkâ€™s Unit 42 researchers said that the targeted cyberespionage campaign is distinct from the ones that the FBI and CISA warned about in September.\n\nThe bug is a critical authentication bypass flaw â€“ CVE-2021-40539 â€“ that allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). Zoho patched the vulnerability in September, but itâ€™s been actively exploited in the wild starting at least as early as August when it was a zero-day, opening the corporate doors to attackers who can run amok as they get free rein across usersâ€™ Active Directory (AD) and cloud accounts.\n\nConsequences of a successful exploit can be significant: The Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus is a self-service password management and single sign-on (SSO) platform for AD and cloud apps, meaning that any cyberattacker able to take control of the platform would have multiple pivot points into both mission-critical apps (and their sensitive data) and other parts of the corporate network via AD. It is, in other words, a powerful, highly privileged application that can act as a convenient point-of-entry to areas deep inside an enterpriseâ€™s footprint, for both users and attackers alike.\n\nCISAâ€™s alert explained that in the earlier attacks,  state-backed, advanced persistent threats (APTs) were deploying a specific webshell and other techniques to maintain persistence in victim environments.\n\nNine days after the CISA alert, Unit 42 researchers saw yet another, unrelated campaign kick off starting on Sept. 17, as a different actor started scanning for unpatched servers. On Sept. 22, after five days of harvesting data on potential targets, exploitation attempts started up and likely continued into early October.\n\nUnit 42 researchers believe that the actor more or less indiscriminately targeted unpatched servers across the spectrum, from education to the Department of Defense, with scans of at least 370 Zoho ManageEngine servers in the U.S. alone.\n\nâ€œWhile we lack insight into the totality of organizations that were exploited during this campaign, we believe that, globally, at least nine entities across the technology, defense, healthcare, energy and education industries were compromised.â€ they said.\nGodzilla Webshell Does Some Heavy Lifting\n\nUnit 42 said that after threat actors exploited CVE-2021-40539 to gain RCE, they quickly moved laterally to deploy several pieces of malware, relying particularly on the publicly available Godzilla webshell.\n\nThe actor uploaded several Godzilla variations to compromised servers and planted some new malware tools as well, including a custom Golang-based open-source backdoor called NGLite and a new credential-stealer that Unit 42 is tracking as KdcSponge.\n\nâ€œThe threat actors then used either the webshell or the NGLite payload to run commands and move laterally to other systems on the network, while they exfiltrated files of interest simply by downloading them from the web server,â€ according to the analysis. After the actors pivoted to a domain controller, they installed the new KdcSponge stealer, which is designed to harvest usernames and passwords from domain controllers as accounts attempt to authenticate to the domain via Kerberos.\n\nBoth Godzilla and NGLite are written in Chinese and are free for the taking on GitHub.\n\nâ€œWe believe threat actors deployed these tools in combination as a form of redundancy to maintain access to high-interest networks,â€ Unit 42 surmised. The researchers described Godzilla as something of a multi-function pocket knife of a webshell, noting that it â€œparses inbound HTTP POST requests, decrypts the data with a secret key, executes decrypted content to carry out additional functionality and returns the result via a HTTP response.â€\n\nAs such, attackers can refrain from inflicting targeted systems with code thatâ€™s likely to be flagged as malicious until theyâ€™re ready to dynamically execute it, researchers said.\nUsing NKN to Communicate Is an Eye-Opener\n\nâ€œNGLite is characterized by its author as an â€˜anonymous cross-platform remote control program based on blockchain technology,\'â€ United 42 researchers Robert Falcone, Jeff White and Peter Renals explained. â€œIt leverages New Kind of Network (NKN) infrastructure for its command and control (C2) communications, which theoretically results in anonymity for its users.â€\n\nThe researchers noted that using NKN â€“ a legitimate networking service that uses blockchain technology to support a decentralized network of peers â€“ for a C2 channel is â€œvery uncommon.â€\n\nâ€œWe have seen only 13 samples communicating with NKN altogether â€“ nine NGLite samples and four related to a legitimate open-source utility called Surge that uses NKN for file sharing.â€\nThreat Actor Shares TTPs with Emissary Panda\n\nUnit 42 said the identity of the threat actor is unclear, but researchers saw correlations in tactics and tooling between the attacker and that of Threat Group 3390, aka Emissary Panda, APT27, Bronze Union and LuckyMouse), an APT thatâ€™s been around since 2013 and which is believed to operate from China.\n\nâ€œSpecifically, as documented by SecureWorks in an article on a previous TG-3390 operation, we can see that TG-3390 similarly used web exploitation and another popular Chinese webshell called ChinaChopper for their initial footholds before leveraging legitimate stolen credentials for lateral movement and attacks on a domain controller,â€ Unit 42 said. â€œWhile the webshells and exploits differ, once the actors achieved access into the environment, we noted an overlap in some of their exfiltration tooling.â€\n\n110921 08:51 UPDATE: Microsoft said on Monday that itâ€™s attributing this campaign with high confidence to DEV-0322, a group operating out of China, â€œbased on observed infrastructure, victimology, tactics, and procedures.â€\n\nMicrosoftâ€™s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has previously detected DEV-0322 taking part in attacks targeting the SolarWinds Serv-U software, which had a zero day â€“ CVE-2021-35211, a remote memory escape â€“ that SolarWinds patched in July.\n\nMSTIC researchers said that the attacks in this new round of beating up Zoho password manager are installing a custom IIS module. IIS, or Internet Information Services, is an extensible web server software created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.\n\nBesides the custom IIS module, DEV-0322 also deployed a trojan that MSTIC is calling Trojan:Win64/Zebracon that uses hardcoded credentials to make connections to suspected DEV-0322-compromised Zimbra email servers.\n\nIn its Sept. 16 alert, CISA recommended that organizations that spot indicators of compromise related to ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus should â€œtake action immediately.â€\n\nAlso, CISA strongly recommended domain-wide password resets and double Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) password resets, â€œif any indication is found that the NTDS.dit file was compromised.â€\nClassic Cyberespionage Targets: Healthcare and Energy\n\nIf the actor behind this second Zoho-focused campaign does turn out to be a Chinese APT, it wonâ€™t be surprising, some said. Dave Klein, cyber evangelist and director at Cymulate, pointed to the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (PRC) having a well-documented, continued interest in healthcare and energy infrastructure data.\n\nHe pointed to the 2015 breach of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as an example. The massive breach was overwhelmingly attributed to the PRC. It included exquisitely sensitive information, including millions of federal employeesâ€™ fingerprints, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, employee performance records, employment history, employment benefits, resumes, school transcripts, military service documentation and psychological data from interviews conducted by background investigators.\n\nâ€œThe PRC got into clearance background information data including very sensitive information. Subsequently in that case they were looking for weaknesses in US classified personnel â€“ which would include health hardships â€“ either personally or related to them,â€ Klein told Threapost via email on Monday.\n\nHe noted that following the OPM breach, some healthcare agencies were subsequently breached, including Anthem Health: an attack that affected more than 78 million people. â€œThe interest in healthcare data globally continues not only for espionage purposes against targets â€“ building an inventory of hardships/weak points as well as seeking out healthcare data to better serve their local industries,â€ Klein noted. â€œOn energy, the interest is both on stealing industrial espionage information as well as to set up compromises in critical infrastructures for potential use in cases of future hostilities.â€\nIf Patching Isnâ€™t Mandatory, a Breach Is a Given\n\nMike Denapoli, lead security architect at Cymulate, added that well-documented (and patched) vulnerabilities in massively popular platforms like Microsoft Exchange and MangeEngine are ripe fruit for threat actors to pluck. Organizations that canâ€™t or wonâ€™t patch are sitting ducks, he said.\n\nâ€œFor whatever the reasons may be (downtime avoidance, fear over patches disrupting workflows, etc.), attackers know these systems are vulnerable, and are making sure to take advantage of any organization that doesnâ€™t keep patching updated,â€ Denapoli told Threatpost. â€œWe have reached the point where patching is a must â€“ within a reasonable amount of time â€“ and needs to be performed. While you donâ€™t have to patch immediately, you must patch regularly. Downtime is mandatory. Testing is mandatory. If not, then a breach is mandatory.â€', 'news/images/114.png', '', '<br/>'),

They found the bugs in the closed commercial BT stack used by 1,400+ embedded chip components and detailed a host of attack types they can cause: Mainly denial of service (DoS) via firmware crashes (the term â€œbrakâ€ is actually Norwegian for â€œcrashâ€). One of the bugs can also lead to arbitrary code execution (ACE).\n\nSince the paper was published, there have been a number of updates, as vendors have scrambled to patch or to figure out whether or not they will in fact patch, and as researchers have uncovered additional vulnerable devices.\n\nFor instance, researchers subsequently discovered that BrakTooth affects iPhones and Macbooks. The bugs also affect Microsoft Surface laptops, Dell desktop PCs and laptops, smartphones from Sony and Oppo, and audio offerings from Walmart and Panasonic, among other devices.\n\nAs of September, the team had analyzed 13 pieces of BT hardware from 11 vendors and came up with a list of 20 CVEs, with four CVE assignments pending from Intel and Qualcomm.\n\nSince then, Qualcomm has issued CVEs for V6 (8.6) and V15 (8.15).\n\nAs of September, some of the bugs were patched, while others were in the process of being patched. But, as researchers said in the paper, â€œit is highly probable that many other products (beyond the â‰ˆ1400 entries observed in Bluetooth listing) are affected by BrakTooth,â€ including BT system-on-chips (SoCs), BT modules or additional BT end products.\n\nOn Monday, the Singapore researchers updated their table of affected devices, after the chipset vendors Airoha, Mediatek and Samsung reported that some of their devices are vulnerable.\nPatches Are Still in the Works\n\nSome devices from Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung are still awaiting patches; and some from Qualcomm and Texas Instruments are listed as â€œno fix,â€ as in, the vendors arenâ€™t planning to issue patches. Other vendors are still investigating the issue. A list of known affected vendors can be found in the research paper and below.\n\nBluetooth Should Mind Its Ps & Qs\n\nOne expert noted that BrakTooth exemplifies attackersâ€™ â€œby any means necessaryâ€ mentality.\n\nGarret Grajek, CEO of cloud-based access review engine vendor YouAttest, told Threatpost that attackers are poring over surface areas in order to find crevices to dig their fangs into. Bluetooth is nice and permeable, being â€œa mechanism with the most variants and thus cracks to exploit,â€ Grajek said via email on Friday.\n\nTo stay safe, the obvious advice holds, he said: i.e., patch when necessary.\n\nAnd as recommended by both CISA and FBI, another key is to apply the principle of least privilege and ensure that the identities that would be compromised in an attack such as BrakTooth couldnâ€™t allow adversaries to cause system damage.\n\nThe NIST recommendation is for all accounts, such as the Bluetooth service account, to be â€œchecked to see they are not granted too much privilege to overtake the machine and extend attacks into the enterprise,â€ Grajek noted.\n\nMake it so, via both access controls and â€œvigilant access certifications conducted on a periodic basis,â€ he advised.\nNo Big Surprise That Legacy Code Is Buggy\n\nSaryu Nayyar, CEO of Gurucul, noted that itâ€™s no surprise that there are a number of vulnerabilities in Bluetooth, â€œgiven that itâ€™s a legacy wireless technology.â€ The real question, she proposed: Can the code be fixed?\n\nâ€œBecause phones and PCs use Bluetooth extensively, just about everyone is potentially affected by these vulnerabilities,â€ she pointed out.\n\nThe bugs were found in complex codebases that have been tested for weaknesses â€œhundreds or thousands of times,â€ noted Doug Britton, CEO of Haystack Solutions â€“ context that makes clear that we need â€œnimbleâ€ security minds.\n\nâ€œCompanies need to keep investing in brains, not tools,â€ Britton told Threatpost via email. â€œCompanies need to have security minds that can go off script when the attacker does. These nimble security minds are needed in the product vendors (such as those affected by these vulnerabilities) and the companies that utilize these products. Creativity will be needed on the part of product customers to look for potential indicia of attack. â€œ\nKeep Your Feelers Out for Nibbles\n\nIn an email on Friday, Nayyar recommended that enterprises that choose to allow Bluetooth on their networks should monitor it for abnormal activities. They should also inform employees of the potential for BrakTooth compromise: â€œIndividual users have to be aware of the potential for Bluetooth compromises, but their organizations have to help them,â€ she added.\n\nIn many cases, organizations can identify unusual Bluetooth activity and let users know that there might be a problem, Nayyard suggested. â€œThis is really the only way of identifying and remediating potential attacks against both individual devices and networks in general.â€', 'news/images/115.png', '', '<br/>');

(106, 'Google Patches 19 Vulnerabilities in Chrome 95 Browser Refresh', '2021-10-20', 'Malwarebytes Blog', '(1)Google has released an update to address multiple security flaws for the third time in less than a month. This time, the patch addresses 19 vulnerabilities, five of which are classed as \"high\" risk', 'For the third time in a month Google has issued an update to patch for several security issues. This time the update patches 19 vulnerabilities, of which 5 are classified as â€œhighâ€ risk vulnerabilities.\n\nIn an update announcement for Chrome 95.0.4638.54, Google specifies the 16 vulnerabilities that were found by external researchers.\n\nThe CVEs\nPublicly disclosed computer security flaws are listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Its goal is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, databases, and services).\n\nBelow are the CVEs attributed to external researchers that got rated as high risk:\n\nCVE-2021-37981 (High CVSS 7.7) : Heap buffer overflow in Skia. The vulnerability exists due to a boundary error when processing untrusted HTML content in Skia. A remote attacker can create a specially crafted web page, trick the victim into opening it, trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nCVE-2021-37982 (High CVSS 7.7): Use after free in Incognito. The vulnerability exists due to a use-after-free error within the Incognito component in Google Chrome. A remote attacker can create a specially crafted web page, trick the victim into visiting it, trigger a use-after-free error and execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nCVE-2021-37983 (High CVSS 7.7): Use after free in Dev Tools. The vulnerability exists due to a use-after-free error within the Dev Tools component in Google Chrome. A remote attacker can create a specially crafted web page, trick the victim into visiting it, trigger a use-after-free error and execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nCVE-2021-37984 (High CVSS 7.7): Heap buffer overflow in PDFium. The vulnerability exists due to a boundary error when processing untrusted HTML content in PDFium. A remote attacker can create a specially crafted web page, trick the victim into opening it, trigger a heap-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nCVE-2021-37985 (High CVSS 7.7) : Use after free in V8. The vulnerability exists due to a use-after-free error within the V8 component in Google Chrome. A remote attacker can create a specially crafted web page, trick the victim into visiting it, trigger a use-after-free error and execute arbitrary code on the target system.\nHeap buffer overflow\nA buffer overflow is a type of software vulnerability that exists when an area of memory within a software application reaches its address boundary and writes into an adjacent memory region. In software exploit code, two common areas that are targeted for overflows are the stack and the heap. So, by creating a specially crafted input, attackers could use this vulnerability to write code into a memory location where they normally wouldnâ€™t have access.\n\nUse after free\nUse after free (UAF) is a vulnerability caused by the incorrect use of dynamic memory during a programâ€™s operation. If, after freeing a memory location, a program does not clear the pointer to that memory, an attacker can use the error to manipulate the program.\n\nSkia\nSkia was developed as an open-source graphics library, written in C++ which abstracts away platform-specific graphics API. After Google acquired it in 2005, Chrome uses Skia for nearly all graphics operations, including text rendering.\n\nIncognito\nIncognito mode in Google Chrome â€“ and other browsersâ€”is essentially a setting on your web browser to disallow the storing of local data relating to the websites you surf. When surfing the web in this mode, your browsing history will not be recorded.\n\nDev Tools\nChrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. The Chrome DevTools are a set of web authoring and debugging tools that web developers can use to iterate, debug and profile their site.\n\nV8\nV8 is Googleâ€™s open source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine. Basically, itâ€™s the engine that reads JavaScript V8 and translates the JavaScript code directly into machine code so that computers can actually understand it. This way the code can be run while browsing. WebAssembly is a binary format that allows you to run code from programming languages other than JavaScript on the web efficiently and securely. This format is handled by V8 as well.\n\nPDFium\nPdfium.Net SDK is the leading .Net library for generating, manipulating and viewing files in the portable document format. It is used in Chrome for displaying PDFs and print preview. Itâ€™s also used in Android for PDF rendering.\n\nHow to protect yourself\nIf youâ€™re a Chrome user, you should update to version 95.0.4638.54 as soon as possible. Users of other Chromium browsers should be on the lookout for updates that fix the vulnerabilities they will have in common.\n\nThe easiest way to update Chrome is to allow Chrome to update automatically, which basically uses the same method as outlined below but does not require your attention. But you can end up lagging behind if you never close the browser or if something goes wrong, such as an extension stopping you from updating the browser.\n\nSo, it doesnâ€™t hurt to check now and then. And now would be a good time, given the working exploits. My preferred method is to have Chrome open the page chrome://settings/help which you can also find by clicking Settings > About Chrome.\n\nIf there is an update available, Chrome will notify you and start downloading it. Then all you have to do is relaunch the browser in order for the update to complete.\n', 'news/images/120.png', '', '<br/>'),

(112, 'Gigabyte Allegedly Hit by AvosLocker Ransomware', '2021-10-21', 'Threatpost', '(1)The AvosLocker ransomware gang claims to have broken into Gigabyte\'s network and leaked a sample of files stolen from the Taiwanese company\'s network. It\'s attempting to sell the remainder.\n(2)The ', '\n\nIf AvosLocker stole Gigabyteâ€™s master keys, threat actors could force hardware to download fake drivers or BIOS updates in a supply-chain attack a la SolarWinds.\n\nThe AvosLocker ransomware gang is claiming that it breached tech giant Gigabyte and has leaked a sample of what it claims are files stolen from the Taiwanese companyâ€™s network. Itâ€™s offering to sell the rest.\n\nOn Wednesday, the gang posted a â€œpress releaseâ€ announcing that it had purportedly gutted the motherboard/server maker, though it didnâ€™t say when or how. The leaked files, seen by PrivacySharks and by Threatpost, appear to contain confidential details regarding deals with third-party companies and identifiable information about employees.\n\nPrivacySharks has reached out to AvosLocker for more information about the breach. Threatpost has reached out to Gigabyte but hasnâ€™t heard back yet.\n\nBelow is a screen capture of AvosLockerâ€™s announcement, which refers to a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) between Gigabyte and Barracuda Networks. The NDA, which Threatpost has viewed, is dated June 2007 and signed on behalf of Barracuda by â€œDrakoâ€ â€“ which, if authentic, presumably refers to Barracuda co-founder Dean Drako.\n\nâ€œGigabyte INC suffered a breach, and this is a sample of the files weâ€™ve downloaded from their network. Barracuda NDA + full dir list leaked in sample,â€ according to AvosLockerâ€™s statement.\n\nWhat Was Leaked\n\nIn a Thursday post, PrivacySharks said that an independent security researcher affiliated with the company has viewed the contents of a leaked 14.9MB file called â€œproof.zipâ€ that was purportedly exfiltrated from Gigabyte.\n\nThe researcher said that it contains the following list of sensitive information:\n\n    Potential credit-card details. Fortunately, if these files contain credit-card information, the credit cards may be expired, as this folder is from 2014.\n    Password and username details.\n    Employee payroll details.\n    HR agreements with consultants as well as full names, images and CVs.\n    10 PDF documents in a file named â€œPassports.â€\n    Information on more than 1,500 job candidates, including full names, CVs, resumes and applications. There are also Zoom details with what appears to be personal information on each candidate.\n    A folder named â€œMailchimpâ€ containing GSM Account Database information. This could include email addresses.\n    A zip folder containing an NDA and information of a deal with Barracuda Networks worth $100,000+.\n    In addition to Barracuda Networks, the leak includes various data from the following well-known companies: Amazon, BestBuy, Black Magic, Blizzard, Intel and Kingston.\n    A .txt file named â€œTreeâ€ containing 133,352 lines of folder and file names stolen in the breach.\n    Business expenses from trips such as â€œHawaii 2019,â€ including money spent on luau drinks, Uber trips and tips.\n    Images from company events, including Christmas parties, Halloween parties and â€œTonyâ€™s Birthday.â€\n\nPrivacySharks shared a number of screen captures showing file trees from the dump. Unless somebody pays to unlock the files, itâ€™s anybodyâ€™s guess whatâ€™s actually in them, but according to Jake Williams, co-founder and CTO at incident response firm BreachQuest, the names suggest that the threat actor â€œfocused on qualityâ€ â€“ a departure from ransomware attackersâ€™ typical focus on grabbing anything and everything.\n\nâ€œThe details in the file tree should be extremely concerning to Gigabyte as they consider the impact of this breach,â€ Williams told Threatpost via email on Thursday. â€œIn most double extortion schemes, the data theft focuses on quantity rather than quality. The file tree from this dump suggests that in this case, the threat actor focused on quality. â€¦ The file tree (directory listing) teased by AvosLocker certainly appears to be the kind of data that would be valuable to a multitude of cybercriminals.\n\nWilliams predicted that the apparent theft of contract details, such as the purported NDA with Barracuda, â€œwill doubtlessly damage relationships with vendors and cause significant reputational losses for Gigabyte.â€\n\nAgain, itâ€™s difficult for outsiders to evaluate the value of trade secrets that may or may not be included in the dumps just based on file and directory names. Williams said that itâ€™s a sure bet that  Gigabyte is now â€œfeverishly evaluating the contents of the files in the directory listings and evaluating the impact of their probable release.â€\nCould Attack Set Off Supply-Chain Ripples?\n\nGigabyte designs and manufactures motherboards for both AMD and Intel platforms. It also produces graphics cards and notebooks in partnership with AMD and Nvidia, including Nvidiaâ€™s Turing chipsets and AMDâ€™s Vega and Polaris chipsets. PrivacySharks suggested that if the leak turns out to include Gigabyteâ€™s master keys â€“ i.e., keys that identify hardware manufacturers as the original developer â€“ threat actors could use them to  force hardware to download fake drivers, BIOS updates or more, as happened with SolarWinds.\n\nAt this point, PrivacySharksâ€™ experts have only found two .KEY files and a few .CRT files, suggesting that â€œthis breach contains no or very little data from the security/tech departments,â€ according to the writeup. â€œHowever, if Gigabyte revokes any keys in the near future, keep this possibility in mind,â€ PrivacySharks suggested.\nData Both Fresh and Stale?\n\nIf the leaked files turn out to be legitimate, some are from a fresh breach, with files dating as recently as May.\n\nâ€œThis indicates that this is a fresh leak with new data,â€ according to PrivacySharks. â€œNot only this, but the date of the files means that some of the personally identifiable data (such as intervieweesâ€™ information, password and username credentials, etc.) could be up-to-date, and therefore, at risk of being compromised.â€\n\nThen again, theyâ€™re also old, as in, years old, which begs the question: Why are the files still kicking around?  Why, if these files are really Gigabyteâ€™s data, did the company hang on to sensitive data for so long, instead of deleting it per rules such as the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Privacy Sharks asked.\n\nâ€œSome of the leaked data calls into question how Gigabyte stores and uses data,â€ the writeup suggested. â€œFor example, we were particularly surprised to find a vast amount of identifiable data about job applicants, including CVs and resumes, which normally include personal data like dates of birth, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nâ€œAs a rule of thumb, companies should not hold onto candidatesâ€™ data after the hiring process is over, and the Gigabyte data leak demonstrates why, as this information can fall into the wrong hands. For this reason, the EU has a GDPR law that requires companies to delete data like this.â€\nTwice Bitten, Twice Not Paying?\n\nThis will be Gigabyteâ€™s second hit in a few months. In August, it was reportedly  the victim of a cyberattack from a ransomware outfit called RansomEXX, though the company didnâ€™t identify the name of the attacker.\n\nThe attackers threatened to release 112GB of data that included valuable, confidential documents from Intel, AMD and American Megatrends. Itâ€™s not yet clear whether the August attack is connected to the recent attack by AvosLocker.\n\nThe amount of the ransom demand wasnâ€™t released. Nor has there been any sign that Gigabyte paid whatever it was. At the time, Gigabyte told The Record that it had isolated the affected servers, notified law enforcement and started an investigation.\n\nOliver Tavakoli, CTO at AI cybersecurity firm Vectra, told Threatpost on Thursday that, while itâ€™s hard to glean the extent of the AvosLocker breach from the sample, it doesnâ€™t look to be as grave as the August breach. â€œIt does not include signs of things which would be considered intellectual property,â€ he said via email. â€œThe leak of HR-related files can certainly be embarrassing, but I donâ€™t imagine that the promise not to leak them will fetch a significant ransom.â€\n\nYou canâ€™t blame the crooks for trying: Ransomware outfits apparently see computer makers as juicy targets willing to fork over beaucoup bucks. In May, REvil demanded $50 million in ransom from computer maker Acer. It went ahead with a copy-paste a month later, launching an audacious attack on Apple just hours before its splashy new product launch,  again demanding a fat $50 million payoff.\nAvosLocker and Its Auction Gimmick\n\nAs Cyble reported in July, AvosLocker is a new ransomware group thatâ€™s been infecting Windows machines with malware thatâ€™s primarily distributed via spam email campaigns or funky advertisements.\n\nEarlier this month, the gang reportedly revamped its site to create a way to auction off the data of recalcitrant victims who refuse to pay ransom. Itâ€™s not the first ransomware gang to pull this stunt, which is meant to add yet another thumbscrew to the double-extortion gambit of not only freezing victimsâ€™ systems but also threatening to publish stolen data if they donâ€™t pay up. In fact, other ransomware gangs cooked up the added pressure point in 2020, including the REvil ransomware gang.\n\nBut ransomware experts say that the threat of auction isnâ€™t real and shouldnâ€™t be taken seriously.\n\nItâ€™s just a form of victim intimidation, and a â€œvery low-quality oneâ€ at that, according to Yelisey Boguslavskiy head of research at the cyber risk prevention firm Advanced Intelligence.\n\nâ€œThis is simply a button on a website,â€ Boguslavskiy told Threatpost on Thursday.\n\nâ€œThe underground auctions do exist â€“ [the Exploit forum being] the most exemplary case,â€ he said. â€œHowever, in the years of the forumâ€™s existence, there were never cases when actors came to Exploit with [offerings] similar to the ones which RaaS [ransomware as-a-service] groups make.â€\n\nTo put it simply, â€œno one in the underground has offered stolen files, since this is not what the actors are willing to pay for,â€ Boguslavskiy said. â€œThe auction button is completely fake. There is no chance anyone will use it simply because it is useless.â€\nSame Old Same Old\n\nBoguslavskiy said that cases like this are becoming â€œvery typical for the post-2020/2021 ransomware.â€\n\nSuch attacks are coming from smaller groups or groups with mediocre skills who â€œbelieve that they can extort ransom by simply stealing and publishing the data on shame blogs,â€ he said. â€œHowever, such blackmailing only works as a force multiplier or an integral component of a larger holistic ransomware operation built around maximizing the risks for victims if they donâ€™t pay.â€\n\nAdvIntel used Conti as an example: While the RaaS group steals data and threatens to publish it, Conti integrates the methodology into a larger context, which Boguslavskiy described as locking and encrypting the networks, removing backups, investigating networks for weeks to identify the most critical information and performing smart negotiations.\n\nâ€œIn other words, a ransomware group can definitely leverage data exfiltration to get paid, however, only if they do it in a very smart, strategic and sophisticated way,â€ he explained. â€œAnd this is not the case with AvosLocker and/or 80 percent RaaS on todayâ€™s landscape (a big difference from 2019/2020 when more groups were like Conti).â€\n\nItâ€™s like heart surgery, he said: â€œGroups like AvosLocker, REvil, or LockBit are trying to perform a surgery without having skills and tools, and as a result, they donâ€™t get paid the ransom.â€\nSimple Threats of Dumping Files Donâ€™t Scare Victims\n\nâ€œThey do believe that a simple threat of dumping a set of files on a blog will force the victim to pay,â€ Boguslavskiy said, but thatâ€™s mostly because the media has been on a two-year scare fest about ransomware that, in reality, doesnâ€™t stand up to the smell test.\n\nâ€œ[Itâ€™s] simply not true,â€ he said, and thatâ€™s evidenced by the fact that large amounts of unimportant data from hundreds of companies get dumped on shame blogs of ransomware groups such as SunCrypt or LockBit.\n\nWhat else are the crooks going to do with it, after all?\n\nâ€œThey dump it there because they are not being paid. These groups expect huge payments as after stealing some files they feel omnipotent, but in reality, for them, it all ends up not with a bang but a whimper (to put it more poetically), when they are left with $0 on their account and have nothing else to do than dump files on TOR,â€ Boguslavskiy commented.\n\n102121 16:20 UPDATE: Added input from Oliver Tavakoli and Jake Williams and information about August 2021 RansomEXX ransomware attack.\n', 'news/images/126.png', '', '<br/>'),

An attacker can abuse this mechanism to create a unique URL for a target user and then force the browsers of visitors to another website to request the same URL.\n\nDepending on the browserâ€™s response, the attacker will determine if the visitor is the same user. This technique can be used for fingerprinting or spear phishing attacks.\n\nSecurity researcher Julien Cretel told The Daily Swig that the paper inspired him to check â€œwhether Slack\'s file-sharing functionality was vulnerable to Leaky Image, and sure enough, it was... and still isâ€.\nFrom file-sharing to de-anonymization\n\nThe XSLeak in Slack, which Cretel has documented comprehensively on his blog, is contingent on the attacker having a user account in the same Slack workspace as their targets and being able to send them direct messages.\n\nWhen a user uploads a file in a direct messaging channel, Slack generates a URL that is only accessible to parties to the conversation. Other users, regardless of being part of the Slack group or not, will be redirected to the main page when they try to retrieve the URL.\n\nSlack uses the â€˜SameSite=laxâ€™ directive to protect its session cookie, which means it is only available to requests from domains under specific conditions.\n\nHowever, Cretel shows that with some simple JavaScript coding, an attacker can create a webpage that circumvents the SameSite protection and fetches the URL. If the resource is accessible, the attacker confirms that the visitor is in fact the same Slack user.\n\nCretel created a novel technique leveraging â€˜form-actionâ€™, a directive available on Chromium-based browsers, in order to detect multiple Slack users. He also used Slackâ€™s group DM messages to reduce the number of file uploads required to identify target users.\n\nMitigation, not remediation\n\nThe bug has some limitations: it does not work on the desktop and mobile app or non-Chromium browsers such as Firefox and Safari.\n\nCretel has filed an issue on the Chromium bug-reporting platform in the hope of getting the form-action directive quirk addressed.\n\nHowever, the researcher said Slack has declined to fix the bug on the grounds that, contrary to public services like Twitter, Slack is a trusted workspace and â€œthere is at least some implied measure of trust, or at least familiarity, between two users in a Slack Workspaceâ€.\n\nHowever, he told The Daily Swig that â€œSlackâ€™s response is somewhat conflicted. On the one hand, they assume that members of a given workspace are benevolent and trust each other; on the other hand, they urge workspace admins to diligently curate the list of members in order to prevent abuse.â€\n\nIn many Slack workspaces, the barrier of entry is very low. For example, Slack has a default setting that allows non-guest members to invite others to their workspace. And some Slack workspaces have effectively become very large, cross-business messaging forums.\n\nCretel said: â€œAlthough I\'m underwhelmed by their response, I must admit Iâ€™m grateful that Slack allowed me to disclose the bug. Now that itâ€™s in the open, perhaps pressure from their customers will make them reconsider their stance.â€', 'news/images/127.png', '', '<br/>');

It then waits to either receive a target to attack from a remote operator through port 19412 or from another related module running on the same machine, he wrote.\r\n\r\nGolang, also known as Go, is aimed at simplifying how software is built by making it easy for developers to compile the same code for different systems. This feature may be the reason why itâ€™s caught on with malware developers in the last few years, since it also makes it easier for attackers to spread malware on multiple operating systems, Caspi wrote.\r\n\r\nIndeed, research from Intezer, which offers a platform for analyzing malware, suggests that there has been a 2,000 percent increase in malware code written in Go being found in the wild, he wrote.\r\n\r\nResearchers said at this time they donâ€™t know which threat actor or actors developed BotenaGo, nor the full scale of devices that are vulnerable to the malware. So far, antivirus protections also donâ€™t seem to recognize the malware, sometimes misidentifying it as a variant of Mirai malware, Caspi wrote.\r\n\r\nSetting Up the Attack\r\nBotenaGo commences its work with some exploratory moves to see if a device is vulnerable to attack, Caspi wrote. It starts by initializing global infection counters that will be printed to the screen, informing the attacker about total successful infections. The malware then looks for the â€˜dlrsâ€™ folder in which to load shell scripts files. If this folder is missing, BotenaGo stops the infection process.\r\n\r\nIn its last step before fully engaging, BotenaGo calls the function â€˜scannerInitExploitsâ€™, â€œwhich initiates the malware attack surface by mapping all offensive functions with its relevant string that represent the targeted system,â€ Caspi wrote.\r\n\r\nOnce it establishes that a device is vulnerable to attack, BotenaGo proceeds with exploit delivery by first querying the target with a simple â€œGETâ€ request. It then searches the returned data from the â€œGETâ€ request with each system signature that was mapped to attack functions.\r\n\r\nResearchers detail several possible attacks that can be carried out using this query. In one,  the malware maps the string â€œServer: Boa/0.93.15â€ to the function â€œmain_infectFunctionGponFiber,â€ which attempts to exploit a vulnerable target, Caspi wrote.\r\n\r\nThis allows the attacker to execute an OS command via a specific web request using a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2020-8958. A SHODAN search turned up nearly 2 million devices that are vulnerable to this type of attack alone, he wrote.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn total, the malware initiates 33 exploit functions that are ready to infect potential victims,â€ Caspi wrote. A full list of the vulnerabilities that BotenaGo can exploit is included in the post.\r\n\r\nBackdooring Devices to Execute Commands\r\nThere are two different ways that the malware can receive commands to target victims, researchers found. One is the create backdoor portsâ€“31421 and 19412â€”that are used in an attack scenario, Caspi wrote.\r\n\r\nâ€œOn port 19412 it will listen to receive the victim IP,â€ he wrote. â€œOnce a connection with information to that port is received, it will loop through mapped exploit functions and execute them with the given IP.â€\r\n\r\nThe second way BotenaGo can receive a target command is by setting a listener to system IO (terminal) user input, getting the command to the device that way, Caspi explained.\r\n\r\nâ€œFor example, if the malware is running locally on a virtual machine, a command can be sent through telnet,â€ he wrote.\r\n\r\nDangers to Corporate Network\r\nGiven its ability to exploit devices connected over internet ports, BotenaGo can be potentially dangerous to corporate networks by gaining access through vulnerable devices, said one security professional.\r\n\r\nâ€œBad actors, such as those at work here, love to exploit these devices to gain access to the internal networks behind them, or just to use it as a platform from which to launch other attacks,â€ observed Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at security firm KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.\r\n\r\nAttackers that can be launched once a hacker takes over a device and piggybacks on the network itâ€™s using include DDoS attacks, which that can lead to extortion of money from victims, he said. Attackers also can host and spread malware using a victimâ€™s internet connection, Kron observed.\r\n\r\nGiven the number of vulnerabilities of which it can take advantage, BotenaGo also shows the importance of keeping IoT and routers updated with the latest firmware and patches to avoid leaving them available to exploit, he added.\r\n', 'news/images/137.png', '', '<br/>'),

The affected product models include extenders, routers, air cards, and modems.\n(2)This vulnerability is listed und', 'Netgear has released a fix for a vulnerability on several of their product models. The affected product models include extenders, routers, air cards, and modems.\n\nThe vulnerability was discovered by researchers at GRIMM, but prior to the planned disclosure date, Netgear released a patch that fixed the underlying bug in one of the affected devices.\nThe vulnerability\n\nPublicly disclosed computer security flaws are listed in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Its goal is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, databases, and services). This vulnerability is listed under CVE-2021-34991 and described as a vulnerability that allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6400v2 1.0.4.106_10.0.80 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the UPnP service, which listens on TCP port 5000 by default. When parsing the universally unique identifier (uuid) request header, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.\n\nThe vulnerability received a CVSS score of 8.8 out of 10 because of some limiting factors. One consolation in the above is that the attacker already has to be inside the LAN to perform this attack. But once they are, the attacker can send a specially crafted header to the UPnP daemon and can remotely run code with root privileges on the affected device.\n\nAnother limiting factor for the attacker lies in the fact that the copy function which overflows the stack is a string copy. As such, it will stop copying characters when it encounters a NULL character. Thus, the exploit cannot include gadgets with NULL bytes. All of the addresses within the UPnPd daemon contain a NULL character as the Most Significant Byte (MSB). But, the researchers that discovered this vulnerability created a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) which bypasses this limitation by omitting the gadgetâ€™s MSB in the payload, and then immediately ends the payload. The string copy which overflows the stack will automatically NULL terminate the string, and thus write a single NULL byte. However, this technique has the disadvantage that it can only write a single NULL byte at the end of the payload. As such, the exploit can only run a single gadget via this technique.\nUPnP\n\nUniversal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points, and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each otherâ€™s presence on the network and establish functional network services. By design, the daemon accepts unauthorized requests of clients that want to receive updates when the UPnP configuration of the network changes. For example, the Xbox One uses UPnP to configure port forwarding necessary for gameplay.\nThe eternal dilemma\n\nUPnP is a convenient way of allowing gadgets to find other devices on your network and, if necessary, modify your router to allow for device access from outside of your network. A UPnP client can obtain the external IP address of your network and add new port forwarding mappings as part of its setup process.\n\nThis is extremely convenient from a consumer perspective as it makes it a lot easier to set up new devices. Unfortunately, with this convenience have come multiple vulnerabilities and large-scale attacks which have exploited UPnP.\n\nVery often, security issues arise from the developersâ€™ inclination to make things easier for their users. It seems there is an impossible to find balance between security and ease of use. It should not be so hard to make secure the default, and if the user wants to increase the ease of use then there should be an option to do so temporarily. Why would you have to open the floodgates permanently just to let one boat in?\nAffected devices\n\nThis list will not be inclusive because some organizations, and ISPs in particular, have a habit of rebranding routers and other network equipment. But a list of product models and the required firmware version can be found in the Netgear security advisory.\nHow to make sure you are safe\n\nNetgear strongly recommends that you download the latest firmware as soon as possible.\n\n    Visit Netgear Support.\n    Start typing your model number in the search box, then select your model from the drop-down menu as soon as it appears.

Regressions showed an 11% increase in power consumption.\n\nPage load times, however, showed regressions [negative performance drops] averaging around 17%.\n\nThe SDSM feature also enables users to toggle between Balanced and Strict modes, giving them greater control over what is and isnâ€™t enabled.\n\nâ€œBalanced learns what sites you use often and trusts those, strict is wellâ€¦ strict,â€ Norman tweeted, adding that Edge users can also add their own exceptions.\n\nJITstream\n\nNorman noted that there are benefits beyond attack surface reduction â€“ due to how the V8 JIT works, several impactful mitigation technologies do not work during the rendering process.\n\nWith JIT disabled, these technologies can also be utilized â€“ for example Controlflow-Enforcement Technology (CET), a new hardware-based exploit mitigation from Intel, and Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG), which cannot be used with JIT engines.\n\nâ€œBy disabling JIT, we can enable both mitigations and make exploitation of security bugs in any renderer process component more difficult,â€ wrote Norman.\n\nMore information on other features bundled with the latest version of Edge is available in the release notes.', 'news/images/151.png', '', '<br/>'),
(138, 'A new DuckDuckGo tool is supposed to prevent apps from tracking Android users', '2021-11-20', 'The Verge', '(1)DuckDuckGoâ€™s new tool aims to prevent apps from tracking Android users.\n(2)Once App Tracking Protection is enabled, it will run in the background as you use your phone. The tool recognizes when a', 'DuckDuckGoâ€™s new tool aims to prevent apps from tracking Android users, first reported by Wired. The tool, called App Tracking Protection, hopes to offer more protection from third-party trackers than Appleâ€™s App Tracking Transparency feature, which gives users the choice to opt-out of data tracking within apps.\n\nHowever, DuckDuckGoâ€™s tool hasnâ€™t been rolled out as part of an update to all Android phones, nor is it available as a separate download â€” itâ€™s built into DuckDuckGoâ€™s privacy-focused browser app, but works across your device. In a post on its blog, the company says that the tool will block â€œtrackers it identifies in other apps from third-party companies.â€ \n\nOnce App Tracking Protection is enabled, it will run in the background as you use your phone. The tool recognizes when an app is about to send data to a third-party tracker, and will then prevent the app from taking your information.\n\nDuckDuckGo says that itâ€™s â€œcontinually working to identify and protect against new trackers,â€ which means that your data should be kept away from any new trackers that crop up. From the DuckDuckGo app, you should also be able to see a real-time view of trackers that the tool has blocked, along with where your data wouldâ€™ve been going.\n\nThe company says that although its App Tracking Protection tool isnâ€™t a virtual private network (VPN), your device will behave as if it is one. â€œThis is because App Tracking Protection uses a local â€˜VPN connectionâ€™ which means that it works its magic right on your smartphone,â€ DuckDuckGo explains in its post. â€œHowever, App Tracking Protection is different from VPNs because it never routes app data through an external server.â€\n\n\nWhile conducting its own test, DuckDuckGo found that more than 96 percent of some of the most popular free Android apps have third-party trackers that most users are unaware of. The company also discovered that 87 percent of these apps send user data to Google, while 68 percent send data to Facebook.\n\nRight now the tool is in beta, but you can join the private waitlist (you wonâ€™t have to enter any personal information to do so). To sign up, download DuckDuckGo from the Google Play Store, and open the app. Hit â€œSettingsâ€ followed by â€œApp Tracking Protectionâ€ in the â€œPrivacy Section.â€ From there, choose â€œJoin the Private Waitlist.â€ DuckDuckGo says it\'s gradually introducing the feature to more people every week.\n\nAs pointed out by Wired, DuckDuckGo obviously doesnâ€™t have the power to change the internal configuration of Android devices like Google does, which means that DuckDuckGoâ€™s tool canâ€™t provide the same app tracking permission prompts that appear on Android and iOS. But if you combine the App Tracking Protection tool and the privacy settings already in Android devices, you can help protect your data from third-party trackers and apps themselves. Like Apple, Google recently started making it more difficult for apps to collect data on users by restricting them from accessing usersâ€™ Advertising IDs after theyâ€™ve opted out of tracking.\n\nAppleâ€™s stringent App Tracking Transparency tools essentially uproot the advertising system on iPhones, reportedly costing social platforms $10 billion as a result. But as a report by The Washington Post explains, Appleâ€™s privacy system is limited, as it only blocks access to usersâ€™ Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).\n\nKamyl Bazbaz, the vice president of communications at DuckDuckGo told The Verge that Appleâ€™s App Tracking Transparency tool â€œonly restricts direct access to a userâ€™s IDFA, the rest is essentially an honor system, where Apple is asking developers to respect user choice not to track but isnâ€™t actually blocking any third party trackers itself. App Tracking Protection blocks those third-party trackers directly, making the tool more powerful than whatâ€™s available on iOS.â€\n\nUpdate November 21st, 9:30AM ET: Updated to clarify that DuckDuckGoâ€™s tool can help provide more protection from third-party trackers when compared to Appleâ€™s App Tracking Transparency tools and Androidâ€™s privacy settings alone. Also added a statement from a DuckDuckGo spokesperson.', 'news/images/152.png', '', '<br/>');
